And sometimes you need to use cryptography in your daily job, like hashes, encryption or digital signatures? And you think cryptography is complex and full of math and it is for nerds only? No, this is not true, every developer can learn how to use cryptographic algorithms. This book will show you how: with code examples and hands-on coding experience, with less math and more practice.\nIt is not required to be а strong mathematician or even not strong mathematician to understand the cryptographic concepts from the developer perspective. This book will teach you the basics of applied cryptography in almost free of math style, following a step-by-step approach with lots of code examples and practical exercises (hands-on experience), just like when you learn Web development, databases or mobile apps. Yes, if you can learn Web development or RESTful services, you can learn the practical aspect of cryptography as well. It is just like learning a new API or a new Web development framework: you learn a combination of concepts + APIs (crypto algorithms implemented in crypto libraries) + tools + best practices how to use these APIs and tools.\nFrom this book you will learn how to use cryptographic algorithms and cryptosystems like hashes, MAC codes and key derivation functions (KFD), random generators, key exchange protocols, symmetric ciphers, encryption schemes, asymmetric cryptosystems, public-key cryptography, elliptic curves, digital signatures and quantum-safe crypto algorithms, together with modern cryptographic tools and libraries.\nI am happy to publish this free developer-friendly practical cryptography book. ****It holds just what developers need to know in order to use cryptography in their every day work. It does not cover the internals of the algorithms and how to design symmetric ciphers, public-key cryptosystems or authentication schemes. It covers the basic understanding of the core cryptographic concepts and how to use them from developer's perspective: libraries, tools, code examples. This is what most developers need to know about cryptography. This is what this book gives to you for free.\nThis Book is for Developers!\nThis book is designed for developers who write code every day, for software engineers who create software systems, Web applications, mobile apps and other software. It may be useful also for DevOps engineers who deal with crypto algorithms and write code to automate the IT infrastructure, for system administrators, who want to learn practical cryptography better, for information security engineers, who need to deal with cryptography every day and to know which ciphers and crypto algorithms are safe and which are broken, along with the possible attacks, for experienced QA engineers who perform security testing and code reviews about security and cryptography, and for many other IT professionals.\nThis book is about using crypto algorithms and cryptographic packages, not about designing ciphers, signature schemes and cryptosystems. You will learn how cryptosystems work (without too much math) and how to use them in your daily job. This book is not 100% free of math, but the complexity level is reduced to match the average developer's level, and complex concepts are explained in simplified and understandable style. This book is created by developers for developers, not by university professors or mathematicians. It is about coding in a smart way, with understanding the concepts and using the crypto algorithms and crypto libraries the right way. It is about the modern crypto algorithms and cryptographic techniques, used today in the software industry (as of Nov 2018).\nWe assume that most developers use higher level programming languages (such as JavaScript, Python, C#, Java and PHP), so most code examples in the book are given in Python, which can be translated to other languages with ease.\nThis Book is Free!\nThe main book author Dr. Svetlin Nakov donates this book and its entire content and code examples for free to the developer and IT community as open-source project, under the MIT license. Why? Because the main book author and the people behind this project believe that the knowledge is for everyone and it should be shared for free, because developers should learn to use cryptography the right way, because our world needs more secure software, because sharing knowledge and skills for free is the greatest miracle of the modern education.\nFor the same reasons, which drive the people to build Wikipedia and share knowledge for free, to publish open-source projects in GitHub and share code for free, to develop open-source software like GNU/Linux and Firefox and distribute it for free, I write and publish this open-source cryptography book for developers. I want to share knowledge and skills, to help the developers to become better professionals. I personally as a developer, when I learn a new technology, I search for free resources and code examples in Internet and I am happy that someone creates and shares them for free. Now it is time to return back to the society and to the developer community and this makes me happy.\nAbout the Author: Dr. Svetlin Nakov\nDr. Svetlin Nakov (http://www.nakov.com) is a passionate software engineer, inspirational technical trainer and tech entrepreneur from Bulgaria, experienced in broad range of languages, software technologies and platforms. He is co-founder of several highly successful tech startups and non-profit organizations and is a technical advisor in several successful blockchain ICO projects. Svetlin is training, innovation and inspiration manager at SoftUni - the largest tech education provider in South-Eastern Europe.\n\nSvetlin Nakov has 20+ years of technical background as software engineer, software project manager, consultant, trainer and entrepreneur with rich experience with .NET, Java EE, information systems, databases, cryptography and software security, Web development, JavaScript, PHP, Python and software engineering. He is the leading author of 15 books on computer programming, software technologies, cryptography, C#, Java, JavaScript, Python and tens of technical and scientific publications. He is a big fan of knowledge sharing and is proud Wikipedia contributor, free books author and open-source supporter.\nSvetlin has been a speaker at hundreds of conferences, seminars, meetups, courses and other trainings in the United States, Singapore, Germany, Egypt, Bulgaria and other locations. He holds a PhD degree in computer science (for his research on computational linguistics and machine learning), several medals from the International Informatics Olympiads (IOI) and the Bulgarian President’s award “John Atanasoff”. He has been a part-time assistant professor / trainer in Sofia University, New Bulgarian University, the Technical University of Sofia, Ngee Ann Polytechnic (Singapore), Kingsland University (USA) and few others.\nCurrently Svetlin Nakov together with his partners drive the global expansion of the largest training center for software engineers in Bulgaria and the region – the Software University, where he inspires and teaches hundred of thousands of young people in computer science, software development, information technologies and digital skills, and gives them a profession and a job.\nThe History behind This Book\nSvetlin Nakov together with tens of co-authors has created and published as open-source projects (in the period 2004-2018) tens of technical books about computer programming and software technologies (see http://www.introprogramming.info and http://www.nakov.com/books), most of which in Bulgarian language. In the last few years Svetlin switches to English and takes global knowledge sharing initiative for better and accessible tech education, demonstrated with creating and sharing free tech books, free tutorials, free tech webinars and seminars, conference talks and many other activities.\nThe book author Svetlin Nakov is involved with applied cryptography from 2005, when he published the book \"Java for Digitally Signing Documents of the Web\" (in Bulgarian), following his master thesis on a similar topic. Later Nakov is involved in his practice as software engineer, tech trainer and entrepreneur, with cryptography, software security and blockchain systems, and his technical expertise grows along with his experience. In 2018 he decides to write a free book to share his knowledge about cryptography and crypto algorithms from developer's perspective and donate this knowledge to the global dev community. The book takes 3 months to be written and gets published in Nov 2018. You can get a free copy from: https://cryptobook.nakov.com.\nThe Software University (SoftUni)\nThe development of this book is supported by the Software University (SoftUni): the biggest and most respected training center for software engineering and digital skills in the South-Eastern Europe, which gives high-quality tech education, practical skills, profession and job to tens of thousands of young people.\n\nSoftUni teaches software engineers in the Software University program, creative and design in the SoftUni Creative program, digital marketing in the SoftUni Digital program, programming and tech skills for kids in the SoftUni Kids program, runs a high school for digital skills SoftUni Svetlina and shares knowledge and skills through the SoftUni Foundation and its SoftUni Free tech educational portal.\nWhy Yet Another Book on Cryptography?\nMost books about cryptography on the market are written either in too academic style with a lot of theory and math or are outdated and do not describe the cryptography used today or are too small, weak in content and unfinished. Others are better, but are not free and accessible for everyone.\nThis book \"Practical Cryptography for Developers\" tries to compensate all above mentioned weak sides of the existing cryptography books on the market: its is free, developer-friendly, comprehensive, with less math and more code examples.\nAcademic Cryptography Books\nMany high-quality academic cryptography books exist on the market and some of them are free, but I can't recommend such a book to а developer. He will be bored and will start hating cryptography after the first chapter or two. Some examples:\n\nOne of the strongest academic book on cryptography concepts is \"A Graduate Course in Applied Cryptography\" (by Dan Boneh and Victor Shoup). It is excellent free book about theoretical cryptography, but is not for developers. It is full of theory, concepts, math and formulas. It does not provide code examples or recommended libraries for developers. Up to date (published in 2017).\nThe \"Crypto 101\" is a free book on cryptography, which is more understandable for developers. It provides more simple explanation for the core cryptographic concepts, but without code examples and recommended libraries and tools. Up to date (published in 2017).\nТhe \"Handbook of Applied Cryptography\" (by Alfred J. Menezes, Paul C. van Oorschot and Scott A. Vanstone) is excellent for higher degree students, but is too academic for developers. It is available for free and explains the theory and the cryptography concepts very well, with lots of high-level math, but it is definitely not for developers. It does not provide working code examples and does not refers the most used crypto libraries in the software industry. Slightly outdated (published in 2001).\nYet another good academic cryptography book is \"Understanding Cryptography: A Textbook for Students and Practitioners\" (by Christof Paar, Bart Preneel, Jan Pelzl). Excellent book on cryptography concepts, well organized, with algorithms in pseudocode, but it is not for developers. It does not provide code examples and recommended libraries for developers. Almost up to date (published in 2010), not free.\nYet another academic book on cryptographical concepts: \"Practical Cryptography\" (by Niels Ferguson and Bruce Schneier, 2003). Provides deep concepts and explanations of the popular crypto algorithms, along with pseudo-code. Slightly outdated (published in 2003).\n\nCrypto Libraries and Their Documentation\nSome crypto libraries try to provide documentation with crypto concepts and code examples, but they are typically limited, sometimes unfinished and not always consistently organized, with a lot of missing points and can serve to help you using certain library, but are not the best source to learn the cryptographic concepts.\nStill, these documentations and manuals are one of the best free learning resources for developers who want to use crypto algorithms, especially experienced engineers with previous knowledge and skills in the area of cryptography. Examples of good documentation about crypto algorithms, coming with some crypto libraries:\n\nNettle Documentation - contains very good description of the most popular cryptographic concepts and popular algorithms (hashes, MAC, symmetric ciphers, signatures) along with reliable and fast C implementation.\nPyCA / Cryptography Documentation - contains basic description of many cryptographic primitives (like hashes, MAC codes, symmetric encryption, authenticated encryption, asymmetric algorithms, key exchange, KDF and others) along with code examples in Python, demonstrating how to use the pyca/cryptography library APIs and its crypto algorithms.\nLibsodium Documentation - combines API documentation with elements of cryptographic concepts. It is bound to the C language, used for the Libsodium project. Provides sample code examples.\nThe Crypto++ Wiki - explains in brief some cryptography concepts along with guidelines how to use the Crypto++ library and the C++ classes, implementing certain crypto algorithms. Provides sample code examples.\nBotan - Developer's Manual - a modern C++ crypto-library, which comes with implementations of many modern crypto algorithms, along with documentation, which includes brief description of the underlying cryptographic concepts.\nLibgcrypt Manual - a cryptographic library, written in C as part of the GnuPG project. Comes with very light introduction to crypto concepts and a boring API documentation with almost no sample code.\n\nPractical Cryptography - Existing Books\nTo be honest, I conducted a comprehensive research of the book market (in Nov 2018) to find the best developer-friendly cryptography books. I was deeply disappointed! I almost didn't find any good practical book about cryptography for programmers, which I could recommend to a friend-developer (not scientist or university student) with confidence that this book is really good and is really what developers need: modern cryptography + simple explained concepts + code examples. I found very good academic books and a few books for developers (rich of code examples) with either not great quality or very focused on certain technology (like a API reference or library manual). Some of them were also outdated, but still valuable.\nFree Cryptography Books for Developers\nThis is the list of free books about practical cryptography for developers:\n\nPractical Cryptography with Go (by Kyle Isom, published 2015) - a mini-book on how to use cryptography with the Go language, full of code examples. It has free edition (read online) and paid editions (PDF, EPUB, MOBI). The book is good, but its scope is limited to describe some concepts very briefly and demonstrate how to use them with code examples. It covers modern symmetric ciphers (like AES-GCM and XSalsa20-Poly1305), key derivation (PBKDF2 and Scrypt), key exchange and ECDH, digital signatures (ECDSA and Ed25519), and few other concepts.\nThe Laws of Cryptography with Java Code (by Neal Wagner, published 2003) - academic-style book on cryptography with working Java examples, implementing certain crypto algorithms (like the AES cipher and the RSA cryptosystem).\nCryptography in .NET Succinctly (by Dirk Strauss, 2017) - a compilation of .NET code examples about using some cryptographic primitives like AES, hashes and RSA signatures from C#. Looks more like a API reference than a serious book explaining when a how to use the mentioned cryptographic algorithms, the concepts of the underlying cryptosystems and the specifics of the underlying algorithms.\n\nNon-Free Cryptography Books for Developers\nI could list a few developer-friendly books for practical cryptography with code examples, which have only paid / commercial versions (no free edition). Most of them are too deeply bound to certain technology like C, C++, Java or JavaScript and don't explain the concepts well. Others have different focus. Some are outdated, some are quite new. This is the list of what I found from my research about developer-friendly crypto books:\n\nSerious Cryptography: A Practical Introduction to Modern Encryption (by by Jean-Philippe Aumasson) - a strong book on cryptography, which combines academic approach with more practical approach, with some code examples in Python, but not for all concepts. Recent (published in 2017). Explains the modern cryptographic concepts and crypto-suits like AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305 and quantum-safe cryptography. This is maybe the best book of what I found.\nSecure Programming Cookbook for C and C++ (by John Viega, Matt Messier) - provides secure coding guidelines for C++ developers, including topics from cryptography (hashes, MAC codes, symmetric ciphers, RSA and DSA, random numbers), with code examples (published in 2009, slightly outdated).\nCryptography for Developers (by Tom Denis) - provides solid fundamentals in cryptography and crypto algorithms, along with implementations in C and assembler with lots of code examples. Written in the middle between an academic style and a developer style. Covers hashes, HMAC, AES, slightly RSA and ECC. Slightly outdated (published in 2007).\nBeginning Cryptography with Java (by David Hook) - a reference for JCA, JCE, JSSE and the Bouncy Castle crypto library with lots of code examples in Java (published in 2005, outdated).\nCryptography for JavaScript Developers: Web Cryptography API, SJCL (by Anish Nath) - a reference full of code examples in JS, but does not explain the concepts like symmetric ciphers, authenticated encryption, etc. (published in 2018).\nHands-On Cryptography with Python (by Samuel Bowne) - nice mini book (87 pages, published in 2018) with lots of code examples in Python, but with very limited scope: hashes, AES and RSA. No signatures, no elliptic curves, no MAC and key derivation functions.\nCryptography in C and C++ (by Michael Welschenbach) - guidelines how to implement crypto algorithms like AES and RSA in C / C++. No signatures, no elliptic curves, no MAC and key derivation functions. Published in 2005 (outdated).\n\nThe absence of good free practical book about cryptography and crypto algorithms for developers with code examples motivates me even more to share my knowledge and skills in a developer-friendly cryptography book. I am happy to be one of the first authors to publish a high-quality free book on practical cryptography for software engineers.\nWhat Does this Book Cover?\nThis book covers the most important modern cryptographic concepts, crypto algorithms and cryptographic constructions, used in the software industry, well illustraed and demonstrated with working code examples:\n\nCryptographic hash functions: concepts, SHA-2, SHA-3, BLAKE2, RIPEMD160, code examples, collisions\nMAC codes: concepts, HMAC, CMAK, UMAC, applications, MAC-based random generators, code examples\nKey derivation functions (KDF): concepts, from password to encryption key, PBKDF2, Scrypt, Bcrypt, Linux crypt(), Argon2, code examples\nPassword encryption techniques: from clear text, through hashing, to modern secure KDFs like Argon2\nRandom numbers and secure random generators: concepts, entropy, secure random numbers, CSPRNG, code examples\nKey exchange techniques: key establishment and key agreement, Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange (DHKE) and Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) with code examples\nEncryption concepts: symmetric and asymmetric ciphers, secret keys, symmetric encryption, encryption schemes, public-key cryptosystems, private and public keys, hybrid encryption, digital signatures\nModern symmetric key ciphers: concepts, block ciphers and stream ciphers, cipher block modes (CBC, CTR, GCM), the AES (Rijndael) cipher, the Salsa20 / ChaCha20 ciphers, with code examples\nSymmetric encryption constructions: authenticated encryption, AES-256-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1307, AES-256-CTR-HMAC, with code examples\nAsymmetric key ciphers and public-key cryptosystems: the RSA cryptosystem (RSA key pairs, encryption, decryption), ECC (elliptic curve cryptography, EC points and multiplication, named curves), ECDH (elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman) key exchange, code examples\nElliptic curves: widely used named curves like secp256k1, P-256, P-521, Curve25519, Curve448-Goldilocks, with code examples\nIntegrated encryption schemes: combining public-key cryptography with symmetric encryption algorithms, the ECIES hybrid encryption scheme, with code examples\nDigital signature algorithms: concepts, signing messages, verifying signatures, RSA signatures, ECDSA and EdDSA\nQuantum-safe cryptography: which classical cryptosystems are quantum-broken and which are quantum-safe, quantum-safe signatures and quantum-safe key exchange algorithms, SPHINCS+, NewHope and others, with code examples\nOther cryptographic concepts: digital certificates, TLS (Transport Layer Security), one-time passwords (OTP), external authentication and OAuth\nCrypto libraries and packages for developers: cryptography in JavaScript, C#, Java, Python, C and C++\nA lot of code examples and exercises, following each major section\n\nWhy Python is Used for the Examples?\nPython is one of easiest languages, a language, which is readable and understandable by all developers (even devs who has zero experience with it). The idea of the code examples is to illustrate the crypto algorithms, encryption schemes and other cryptography concepts in action, not to promote certain library, API, language or technology.\nUse the code examples as reference only, as guideline of how your code might look like, and adopt them to your favorite language and framework. Don't directly copy and paste the code examples. Sometimes we use a library, which is more user friendly and easier to install and use, instead of a faster and more reliable library from another vendor. Sometimes we use hex-encoded keys, ciphertexts, signatures and other values, in order to display them easier on the console, but in practice most apps will use binary encodings for increased performance and reduced network overhead.\nYou are free to adopt the code examples to other languages. At the end of the book we have given examples how to use cryptography in the most popular programming languages: JavaScript, C#, Java and Python. We skip giving examples with the lower level languages like C and C++ because they work better for library writers (to implement efficiently certain algorithm), not for app developers. C and C++ are more complex to setup and build, need more effort to manage the project dependencies and are more prone to errors.\nMost application developers (e.g. Web devs, back-end devs, mobile devs and front-end devs) use higher level languages (like JS, Python, C#, Java, PHP and Go), but all of them will understand the Python code from the examples. If the code was given in C, it would be longer, more complex and less readable.\nPython is widely supported everywhere (in Linux, Windows, Mac, on mobile devices and microcontrollers). All examples can also run online in a virtual machine in online Python environments such as: Repl.it and PythonAnywhere.\nHow to Read This Book?\nThe recommended way to read this is topic by topic (from the start to the end). You may skip chapters and sections that you don't like, but please pass through them, because the content has internal dependencies.\nPlay with the code examples: run them, modify them, break them, explore and experiment with the code and learn by playing.\nTry to solve the practical exercises in chapter. Developers learn best by writing code and this is what I recommend. You are given well described exercise problems, with clear input and output, covering well the content after each major section.\nNow, start your developer journey into the modern practical cryptography. Enjoy the book!\n"},"cryptography-overview.html":{"url":"cryptography-overview.html","title":"Cryptography - Overview","keywords":"","body":"Cryptography - Overview\nOverview of Modern Cryptography\nCryptography has evolved from its first attempts (thousands years ago), through the first successful cryptographic algorithms for developers (like the now retired MD5 and DES) to modern crypto algorithms (like SHA-3, Argon2 and ChaCha20).\nLet's first introduce very shortly the basic cryptography concepts, that developers should know, like cryptographic hash functions (SHA-256, SHA3, RIPEMD and others), HMAC (hashed message authentication code), password to key derivation functions (like Scrypt), the Diffie-Hellman key-exchange protocol, symmetric key encryption schemes (like the AES cipher with CBC and CTR block modes) and asymmetric key encryption schemes with public and private keys (like the RSA cipher and elliptic curves-based cryptography / ECC, the secp256k1 curve and the Ed25519 cryptosystem), digital signatures and ECDSA, as well as the concept of entropy and secure random number generation and quantum-safe cryptography.\nEncrypt / Decrypt Message - Live Demo\nAs a simple example, we shall demonstrate message encryption + decryption using the AES encryption algorithm. Play with this online tool: https://aesencryption.net.\n\nWe shall learn later that behind this simple AES encryption, there are many algorithms and settings hidden inside, like password to key-derivation function and its parameters, block cipher mode, cipher initial vector, message authentication code and others.\nWhat is Cryptography?\nCryptography is the science of providing security and protection of information. It is used everywhere in our digital world: when you open a Web site, send an email or connect to the WiFi network. That's why developers should have at least basic understanding of cryptography and how to use crypto algorithms and crypto libraries, to understand hashing, symmetric and asymmetric ciphers and encryption schemes, as well as digital signatures and the cryptosystems and algorithms behind them.\nEncryption and Keys\nCryptography deals with storing and transmitting data in a secure way, such that only those, for whom it is intended, can read and process it. This may involve encrypting and decrypting data using symmetric or asymmetric encryption schemes, where one or more keys are used to transform data from plain to encrypted form and back.\nSymmetric encryption (like AES, Twofish and ChaCha20) uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt messages, while asymmetric encryption uses a public-key cryptosystem (like RSA or ECC) and a key-pair: public key (encryption key) and corresponding private key (decryption key). Encryption algorithms are often combined in encryption schemes (like AES-256-CTR-HMAC-SHA-256, ChaCha20-Poly1305 or ECIES-secp256k1-AES-128-GCM).\nCryptography deals with keys (large secret numbers) and in many scenarios these keys are derived from numbers, passwords or passphrases using key derivation algorithms (like PBKDF2 and Scrypt).\nDigital Signatures and Message Authentication\nCryptography provides means of digital signing of messages which guarantee message authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation. Most digital signature algorithms (like DSA, ECDSA and EdDSA) use asymmetric key pair (private and public key): the message is signed by the private key and the signature is verified by the corresponding public key. In the bank systems digital signatures are used to sign and approve payments. In blockchain signed transactions allow users to transfer a blockchain asset from one address to another.\nCryptography deals with message authentication algorithms (like HMAC) and message authentication codes (MAC codes) to prove message authenticity, integrity and authorship. Authentication is used side by side with encryption, to ensure secure communication.\nSecure Random Numbers\nCryptography uses random numbers and deals with entropy (unpredictable randomness) and secure generation of random numbers (e.g. using CSPRNG). Secure random numbers are unpredictable by nature and developers should care about them, because broken random generator means compromised or hacked system or app.\nKey Exchange\nCryptography defines key-exchange algorithms (like Diffie-Hellman key exchange and ECDH) and key establishment schemes, used to securely establish encryption keys between two parties that intend to transmit messages securely using encryption. Such algorithms are performed typically when a new secure connection between two parties is established, e.g. when you open a modern Web site or connect to the WiFi network.\nCryptographic Hashes and Password Hashing\nCryptography provides cryptographic hash functions (like SHA-3 and BLAKE2), which transform messages to message digest (hash of fixed length), which cannot be reversed back to the original message and almost uniquely identifies the input. In blockchain systems, for example, hashes are used to generate blockchain addresses, transaction ID and in many other algorithms and protocols. In Git cryptographic hashes are used for generating unique ID for files and commits.\nPassword hashing and password to key derivation functions (like Scrypt and Argon2) protect user passwords and password encrypted documents and data by securely deriving a hash (or key) from a text-based passwords, injecting random parameters (salt) and using a lot of iterations and computing resources to make password cracking slow.\nConfusion and Diffusion in Cryptography\nIn cryptography the hashing, encryption algorithms and random generators follow the Shannon's principles of confusion and diffusion. Confusion means that each bit in the output form a cipher should depend on several parts of the key and input data and thus direct mapping cannot be established. Diffusion means that changing one bit in the input should change approximately half of the bits in the output. These principles are incorporated in most hash functions, MAC algorithms, random number generators, symmetric and asymmetric ciphers.\nCryptographic Libraries\nDevelopers should know the modern cryptographic libraries for their programming language and platform and how to use them. Developing with cryptography requires understanding of the crypto-concepts. Copy / pasting code from Internet or following an example from a blog may lead to insecure design and weak security. Cryptographic libraries are very useful, but you should understand the concepts first, then choose appropriate combination of algorithms and adjust carefully their parameters.\n"},"cryptographic-hash-functions/":{"url":"cryptographic-hash-functions/","title":"Hash Functions","keywords":"","body":"Hash Functions\nIn computer programming hash functions map text (or other data) to integer numbers. Usually different inputs maps to different outputs, but sometimes a collision may happen (different input with the same output).\nCryptographic hash functions transform text or binary data to fixed-length hash value and are known to be collision-resistant and irreversible. Example of cryptographic hash function is SHA3-256:\nSHA3-256(\"hello\") = \"3338be694f50c5f338814986cdf0686453a888b84f424d792af4b9202398f392\"\nThe above SHA3-256 hash calculation can be coded in Python like this:\nimport hashlib, binascii\nsha3_256hash = hashlib.sha3_256(b'hello').digest()\nprint(\"SHA3-256('hello') =\", binascii.hexlify(sha3_256hash))\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/SHA3-256-hello-in-Python.\nThe same SHA3-256 hash calculation can be coded in JavaScript like this (after npm install js-sha3):\nsha3 = require('js-sha3');\nlet sha3_256hash = sha3.sha3_256('hello').toString();\nconsole.log(\"SHA3-256('hello') =\", sha3_256hash);\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/SHA3-256-hello-in-JS.\nHashing (in Software Engineering)\nThe process of calculating the value of certain hash function is called \"hashing\".\n\nIn the above example the text John Smith is hashed to the hash value 02 and Lisa Smith is hashed to 01. The input texts John Smith and Sandra Dee both are hashed to 02 and this is called \"collision\".\nHash functions are irreversible by design, which means that there is no fast algorithm to restore the input message from its hash value.\nIn programming hash functions are used in the implementation of the data structure \"hash-table\" (associative array) which maps values of certain input type to values of another type, e.g. map product name (text) to product price (decimal number).\nA naive hash function is just to sum the bytes of the input data / text. It causes a lot of collisions, e.g. hello and ehllo will have the same hash code. Better hash functions may use the Merkle–Damgård construction scheme, which takes the first byte as state, then transforms the state (e.g. multiplies it by a prime number like 31), then adds the next byte to the state, then again transforms the state and adds the next byte, etc. This significantly reduces the rate of collisions and produces better distribution.\nCryptographic Hash Functions\nIn cryptography, hash functions transform input data of arbitrary size (e.g. a text message) to a result of fixed size (e.g. 256 bits), which is called hash value (or hash code, message digest, or simply hash). Hash functions (hashing algorithms) used in computer cryptography are known as \"cryptographic hash functions\". Examples of such functions are SHA-256 and SHA3-256, which transform arbitrary input to 256-bit output.\n\nCryptographic Hash Functions - Examples\nAs an example, we can take the cryptographic hash function SHA-256 and calculate the hash value of certain text message hello:\nSHA-256(\"hello\") = \"2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824\"\nThe above SHA-256 calculation can be coded in Python like this:\nimport hashlib, binascii\n\nsha256hash = hashlib.sha256(b'hello').digest()\nprint(\"SHA-256('hello') = \", binascii.hexlify(sha256hash))\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/SHA-256-hello-in-Python.\nThere is no efficient algorithm to find the input message (in the above example hello) from its hash value (in the above example 2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824). It is well-known that cryptographic hash functions cannot be reversed back, so they are used widely to encode an input without revealing it (e.g. encode a private key to a blockchain address without revealing the key).\nAs another example, we can take the cryptographic hash function SHA3-512 and calculate the hash value of the same text message hello:\nSHA3-512(\"hello\") = \"75d527c368f2efe848ecf6b073a36767800805e9eef2b1857d5f984f036eb6df891d75f72d9b154518c1cd58835286d1da9a38deba3de98b5a53e5ed78a84976\"\nCryptographic Hash Functions - Live Demo\nPlay with most popular cryptographic hash functions online: https://www.fileformat.info/tool/hash.htm.\n\nCryptographic hash functions are widely used in cryptography, in computer programming and in blockchain systems.\n"},"cryptographic-hash-functions/crypto-hashes-and-collisions.html":{"url":"cryptographic-hash-functions/crypto-hashes-and-collisions.html","title":"Crypto Hashes and Collisions","keywords":"","body":"Crypto Hashes and Collisions\nDifferent input messages are expected to produce different output hash values (message digest).\n\nHash Collisions\nA collision means the same hash value for two different inputs. For simple hash functions it is easy to reach a collision. For example, assume a hash function h(text) sums of all character codes in a text. It will produce the same hash value (collision) for texts holding the same letters in different order, i.e. h('abc') == h('cab') == h('bca'). To avoid collisions, cryptographers have designed collision-resistant hash functions.\nCryptographic Hash Functions: No Collisions\nCollisions in the cryptographic hash functions are extremely unlikely to be found, so crypto hashes are considered to almost uniquely identify their corresponding input. Moreover, it is extremely hard to find an input message that hashes to given value.\nCryptographic hash functions are one-way hash functions, which are infeasible to invert. The chance to find a collision (by brute force) for a strong cryptographic hash function (like SHA-256) is extremely little. Let's define this in more details:\n\nLet's have hash value h=hash(p) for certain strong cryptographic hash function hash.\nIt is expected to be extremely hard to find an input p', such that hash(p')=h.\nFor most modern strong cryptographic hash functions there are no known collisions.\n\nThe ideal cryptographic hash function should have the following properties:\n\nDeterministic: the same input message should always result in the same hash value.\nQuick: it should be fast to compute the hash value for any given message.\nHard to analyze: a small change to the input message should totally change the output hash value.\nIrreversible: generating a valid input message from its hash value should be infeasible. This means that there should be no significantly better way than brute force (try all possible input messages).\nNo collisions: it should be extremely hard (or practically impossible) to find two different messages with the same hash.\n\nModern cryptographic hash functions (like SHA2 and SHA3) match the above properties and are used widely in cryptography.\n"},"cryptographic-hash-functions/hash-functions-applications.html":{"url":"cryptographic-hash-functions/hash-functions-applications.html","title":"Hash Functions: Applications","keywords":"","body":"Hash Functions: Applications\nCryptographic hash functions (like SHA-256 and SHA3-256) are used in many scenarios. Let's review their most common applications.\nDocument Integrity\nVerifying the integrity of files / documents / messages. E.g. a SHA256 checksum may confirm that certain file is original (not modified after its checksum was calculated).\n\nThe above screenshot demonstrates how the SHA256 checksums ensure the integrity of the OpenSSL files at the official Web site of OpenSSL.\nStoring Passwords\nStoring passwords and verification of passwords. Instead of keeping a plain-text password in the database, developers usually keep password hashes or more complex values derived from the password (e.g. Scrypt-derived value).\n\nThe above example comes from the /etc/shadow file in a modern Linux system. The above passwords are stored as multiple-round SHA-512 hashes with salt.\nGenerate Unique ID\nGenerate an (almost) unique ID of certain document / message. Cryptographic hash functions almost uniquely identify documents based on their content. In theory collisions are possible with any cryptographic hash function, but are very unlikely to happen, so most systems (like Git) assume that the hash function they use is collistion free.\nUsually a document is hashed and the document ID (hash value) is used later to prove the existence of the document, or to retrieve the document from a storage system. Example of hash-based unique IDs are the commit hashes in Git and GitHub, based on the content of the commit (e.g. 3c3be25bc1757ca99aba55d4157596a8ea217698) and the Bitcoin addresses (e.g. 1BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJaNVN2).\n\nIn the above example the SHA-1 unique ID identifies a certain commit in GitHub.\nPseudorandom Number Generation\nPseudorandom generation and key derivation. Hash values can serve as random numbers. A simple way to generate a random sequence is like this: start from a random seed (entropy collected from random events, such like keyboard clicks or mouse moves). Append \"1\" and calculate the hash to obtain the first random number, then append \"2\" and calculate the hash to obtain the second random number, etc. We shall give a Python example, implementing the described idea.\nProof-of-Work Algorithms\nProof-of-work (PoW) algorithms. Most proof-of-work algorithms calculate a hash value which is bigger than certain value (known as mining difficulty). To find this hash value, miners calculate billions of different hashes and take the biggest of them, because hash numbers are unpredictable. For example, the proof of work problem might be defined as follows: find a number p, such that hash(x + p) holds 10 zero bits at its beginning.\nCryptographic Hashes are Part of Modern Programming\nCryptographic hash functions are so widely used, that they are often implemented as build-in functions in the standard libraries for the modern programming languages and platforms.\n"},"cryptographic-hash-functions/secure-hash-algorithms.html":{"url":"cryptographic-hash-functions/secure-hash-algorithms.html","title":"Secure Hash Algorithms","keywords":"","body":"Secure Hash Algorithms\nIn the past, many cryptographic hash algorithms were proposed and used by software developers.

As general rule, 128-bit hash functions are weaker than 256-bit hash functions, which are weaker than 512-bit hash functions.\nThus, SHA-512 is stronger than SHA-256, so we can expect that for SHA-512 it is more unlikely to practically find a collision than for SHA-256.\nSHA-3, SHA3-256, SHA3-512, Keccak-256\nSHA-3 (and its variants SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512), is considered more secure than SHA-2 (SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512) for the same hash length. For example, SHA3-256 provides more cryptographic strength than SHA-256 for the same hash length (256 bits).\nThe SHA-3 family of functions are representatives of the \"Keccak\" hashes family, which are based on the cryptographic concept \"sponge construction\". Keccak is the winner of the SHA-3 NIST competition.\nUnlike SHA-2, the SHA-3 family of cryptographic hash functions are not vulnerable to the \"length extension attack\".\nSHA-3 is considered highly secure and is published as official recommended crypto standard in the United States.\nThe hash function Keccak-256, which is used in the Ethereum blockchain, is a variant of SHA3-256 with some constants changed in the code.\nThe hash functions SHAKE128(msg, length) and SHAKE256(msg, length) are variants of the SHA3-256 and SHA3-512 algorithms, where the output message length can vary.\nExamples of SHA3 hashes:\nSHA3-256('hello') = 3338be694f50c5f338814986cdf0686453a888b84f424d792af4b9202398f392\nKeccak-256('hello') = 1c8aff950685c2ed4bc3174f3472287b56d9517b9c948127319a09a7a36deac8\nSHA3-512('hello') = 75d527c368f2efe848ecf6b073a36767800805e9eef2b1857d5f984f036eb6df891d75f72d9b154518c1cd58835286d1da9a38deba3de98b5a53e5ed78a84976\nSHAKE-128('hello', 256) = 4a361de3a0e980a55388df742e9b314bd69d918260d9247768d0221df5262380\nSHAKE-256('hello', 160) = 1234075ae4a1e77316cf2d8000974581a343b9eb\nBLAKE2 / BLAKE2s / BLAKE2b\n[BLAKE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAKE\\_%28hash\\_function) / BLAKE2 / BLAKE2s / BLAKE2b is a family of fast, highly secure cryptographic hash functions, providing calculation of 160-bit, 224-bit, 256-bit, 384-bit and 512-bit digest sizes, widely used in modern cryptography. BLAKE is one of the finalists at the SHA-3 NIST competition.\nThe BLAKE2 function is an improved version of BLAKE.\nBLAKE2s (typically 256-bit) is BLAKE2 implementation, performance-optimized for 32-bit microprocessors.\nBLAKE2b (typically 512-bit) is BLAKE2 implementation, performance-optimized for 64-bit microprocessors.\nThe BLAKE2 hash function has similar security strength like SHA-3, but is less used by developers than SHA2 and SHA3.\nExamples of BLAKE hashes:\nBLAKE2s('hello') = 19213bacc58dee6dbde3ceb9a47cbb330b3d86f8cca8997eb00be456f140ca25\nBLAKE2b('hello') = e4cfa39a3d37be31c59609e807970799caa68a19bfaa15135f165085e01d41a65ba1e1b146aeb6bd0092b49eac214c103ccfa3a365954bbbe52f74a2b3620c94\nRIPEMD-160\nRIPEMD-160 is a secure hash function, widely used in cryptography, e.g. in PGP and Bitcoin.\nThe 160-bit variant of RIPEMD is widely used in practice, while the other variations like RIPEMD-128, RIPEMD-256 and RIPEMD-320 are not popular and have disputable security strengths.\nAs recommendation, prefer using SHA-2 and SHA-3 instead of RIPEMD, because they are more stronger than RIPEMD, due to higher bit length and less chance for collisions.\nExamples of RIPEMD hashes:\nRIPEMD-160('hello') = 108f07b8382412612c048d07d13f814118445acd\nRIPEMD-320('hello') = eb0cf45114c56a8421fbcb33430fa22e0cd607560a88bbe14ce70bdf59bf55b11a3906987c487992\nAll of the above popular secure hash functions (SHA-2, SHA-3, BLAKE2, RIPEMD) are not restricted by commercial patents and are free for public use.\nInsecure Hash Functions\nOld hash algorithms like MD5, SHA-0 and SHA-1 are considered insecure and were withdrawn due to cryptographic weaknesses (collisions found). Don't use MD5, SHA-0 and SHA-1! All these hash functions are proven to be cryptographically insecure.\nYou can find in Internet that SHA1 collisions can be practically generated and this results in algorithms for creating fake digital signatures, demonstrated by two different signed PDF documents which hold different content, but have the same hash value and the same digital signature. See https://shattered.io.\nAvoid using of the following hash algorithms, which are considered insecure or have disputable security: MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA-0, SHA-1, Panama, HAVAL (disputable security, collisions found for HAVAL-128), Tiger (disputable, weaknesses found), SipHash (it is not a cryptographic hash function).\nOther Secure Hash Functions\nThe below functions are popular strong cryptographic hash functions, alternatives to SHA-2, SHA-3 and BLAKE2:\n\nWhirlpool is secure cryptographic hash function, which produces 512-bit hashes.\nSM3 is the crypto hash function, officialy standartized by the Chinese government. It is similar to SHA-256 (based on the Merkle–Damgård construction) and produces 256-bit hashes.\nGOST (GOST R 34.11-94) is secure cryptographic hash function, the Russian national standard, described in RFC 4357. It produces 256-bit hashes.\n\nThe below functions are less popular alternatives to SHA-2, SHA-3 and BLAKE, finalists at the SHA-3 NIST competition:\n\nSkein is secure cryptographic hash function, capable to derive 128, 160, 224, 256, 384, 512 and 1024-bit hashes.\nGrøstl is secure cryptographic hash function, capable to derive 224, 256, 384 and 512-bit hashes.\nJH is secure cryptographic hash function, capable to derive 224, 256, 384 and 512-bit hashes.\n\nNo Collisions for SHA-256, SHA3-256, BLAKE2s and RIPEMD-160 are Known\nAs of Oct 2018, no collisions are known for: SHA256, SHA3-256, Keccak-256, BLAKE2s, RIPEMD160 and few others.\nBrute forcing to find hash function collision as general costs: 2128 for SHA256 / SHA3-256 and 280 for RIPEMD160.\nRespectively, on a powerful enough quantum computer, it will cost less time: 2256/3 and 2160/3 respectively. Still (as of September 2018) so powerful quantum computers are not known to exist.\nLearn more about cryptographic hash functions, their strength and attack resistance at: https://z.cash/technology/history-of-hash-function-attacks.html\n"},"cryptographic-hash-functions/hash-functions-examples.html":{"url":"cryptographic-hash-functions/hash-functions-examples.html","title":"Hash Functions - Examples","keywords":"","body":"Hash Functions - Examples\nIn this section we shall provide a few examples about calculating cryptographic hash functions in Python.\nCalculating Cryptographic Hash Functions in Python\nWe shall use the standard Python library hashlib.

These hash functions are designed to consume a lot of computational resources and a lot of memory and to be very hard to be implemented in a hardware devices (such as FPGA integrated circuits or ASIC miners). Such hash functions are known as \"ASIC-resistant\".\nMany hash functions are designed for proof-of-work mining algorithms, e.g. ETHash, Equihash, CryptoNight and Cookoo Cycle. These hash functions are slow to calculate, and usually use GPU hardware (rigs of graphics cards like NVIDIA GTX 1080) or powerful CPU hardware (like Intel Core i7-8700K) and a lot of fast RAM memory (like DDR4 chips). The goal of these mining algorithms is to minimize the centralization of mining by stimulating the small miners (home users and small mining farms) and limit the power of big players in the mining industry (who can afford to build giant mining facilities and data centers). A big number of small players means better decentralization than a small number of big players.\nThe main weapon in the hands of the big mining corporations is considered the ASIC miners, so the design of modern cryptocurrencies and usually includes proof-of-work mining using an ASIC-resistant hashing algorithm or proof-of-stake consensus protocol.\nETHash\nLet's explain in brief the idea behind the ETHash proof-of-work mining hash function used in the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nETHash is the proof-of-work hash function in the Ethereum blockchain.

Let's explain when we need MAC, how to calculate HMAC and how it is related to key derivation functions.\nMessage Authentication Code (MAC)\nMessage Authentication Code (MAC) is cryptographic code, calculated by given key and given message:\nauth_code = MAC(key, msg)\nTypically, it behaves like a hash function: a minor change in the message or in the key results to totally different MAC value. It should be practically infeasible to change the key or the message and get the same MAC value. MAC codes, like hashes, are irreversible: it is impossible to recover the original message or the key from the MAC code. MAC algorithms are also known as \"keyed hash functions\", because they behave like a hash function with a key.\nFor example, the MAC code can be calculated by the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm like this:\nHMAC-SHA256('key', 'some msg') = 32885b49c8a1009e6d66662f8462e7dd5df769a7b725d1d546574e6d5d6e76ad\nThe above HMAC-SHA256 calculation can be coded in Python like this:\nimport hashlib, hmac, binascii\n\nmac = hmac.new(b'key', b'some msg', hashlib.sha256).digest()\nprint(binascii.hexlify(mac))\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/HMAC-SHA256-in-Python.\nThe MAC code is digital authenticity code, like a digital signature, but with pre-shared key. We shall learn more about digital signing and digital signatures later.\nMAC Algorithms\nMany algorithms for calculating message authentication codes (MAC) exist in modern cryptography. The most popular are based on hashing algorithms, like HMAC (Hash-based MAC, e.g. HMAC-SHA256) and KMAC (Keccak-based MAC). Others are based on symmetric ciphers, like CMAC (Cipher-based MAC), GMAC (Galois MAC) and Poly1305 (Bernstein's one-time authenticator). Other MAC algorithms include UMAC (based on universal hashing), VMAC (high-performance block cipher-based MAC) and SipHash (simple, fast, secure MAC).\nWhen We Need MAC Codes?\nA sample scenario for using MAC codes is like this:\n\nTwo parties exchange somehow a certain secret MAC key (pre-shared key).\nWe receive a msg + auth_code from somewhere (e.g. from Internet, from the blockchain, or from email message).\nWe want to be sure that the msg is not tampered, which means that both the key and msg are correct and match the MAC code.\nIn case of tampered message, the MAC code will be incorrect.\n\n\nAuthenticated Encryption: Encrypt / Decrypt Messages using MAC\nAnother scenario to use MAC codes is for authenticated encryption: when we encrypt a message and we want to be sure the decryption password is correct and the decrypted message is the same like the original message before encryption.\n\nFirst, we derive a key from the password. We can use this key for the MAC calculation algorithm (directly or hashed for better security).\nNext, we encrypt the message using the derived key and store the ciphertext in the output.\nFinally, we calculate the MAC code using the derived key and the original message and we append it to the output.\n\nWhen we decrypt the encrypted message (ciphertext + MAC), we proceed as follows:\n\nFirst, we derive a key from the password, entered by the user. It might be the correct password or wrong. We shall find out later.\nNext, we decrypt the message using the derived key. It might be the original message or incorrect message (depends on the password entered).\nFinally, we calculate a MAC code using the derived key + the decrypted message.\nIf the calculated MAC code matches the MAC code in the encrypted message, the password is correct.\nOtherwise, it will be proven that the decrypted message is not the original message and this means that the password is incorrect\n\n\n\nSome authenticated encryption algorithms (such as AES-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305) integrate the MAC calculation into the encryption algorithm and the MAC verification into the decryption algorithm. We shall learn more about these algorithms later.\nThe MAC is stored along with the ciphertext and it does not reveal the password or the original message. Storing the MAC code, visible to anyone is safe, and after decryption, we know whether the message is the original one or not (wrong password).\nMAC-Based Pseudo-Random Generator\nAnother application of MAC codes is for pseudo-random generator functions. We can start from certain salt (constant number or the current date and time or some other randomness) and some seed number (last random number generated, e.g. 0). We can calculate the next_seed as follows:\nnext_seed = MAC(salt, seed)\nThis next pseudo-random number is \"randomly changed\" after each calculation of the above formula and we can use it to generate the next random number in certain range. We shall demonstrated a fully working example in the \"Secure Random Generators\" chapter.\n"},"mac-and-key-derivation/hmac-and-key-derivation.html":{"url":"mac-and-key-derivation/hmac-and-key-derivation.html","title":"HMAC and Key Derivation","keywords":"","body":"HMAC and Key Derivation\nSimply calculating hash_func(key + msg) to obtain a MAC (message authentication code) is considered insecure (see the details). It is recommended to use the HMAC algorithm instead, e.g. HMAC-SHA256 or HMAC-SHA3-512 or other secure MAC algorithm.\nWhat is HMAC?\nHMAC = Hash-based Message Authentication Code (MAC code, calculated using a cryptographic hash function):\nHMAC(key, msg, hash_func) -> hash\nThe results MAC code is a message hash mixed with a secret key.

Simple hashes are vulnerable to dictionary attacks.\nAs more complicated KDF function, you can derive a password by calculating HMAC(salt, msg, SHA256) using some random value called \"salt\", which is stored along with the derived key and used later to derive the same key again from the password.\nUsing HKDF (HMAC-based key derivation) for key derivation is less secure than modern KDFs, so experts recommend using stronger key derivation functions like PBKDF2, Bcrypt, Scrypt and Argon2.

It is vulnerable to many attacks: brute-forcing, dictionary attacks, rainbow attacks and others, which may reverse the hash in practice and attacker can obtain the password.\nCryptographic Key Derivation Functions\nPBKDF2, Bcrypt, Scrypt and Argon2 are significantly stronger key derivation functions and are designed to survive password guessing (brute force) attacks.\nBy design secure key derivation functions use salt (random number, which is different for each key derivation) + many iterations (to speed-down eventual password guessing process). This is a process, known as key stretching.\nTo calculate a secure KDF it takes some CPU time to derive the key (e.g. 0.2 sec) + some memory (RAM). Thus deriving the key is \"computationally expensive\", so password cracking will also be computationally expensive.\nWhen a modern KDF function is used with appropriate config parameters, cracking passwords will be slow (e.g. 5-10 attempts per second, instead of thousands or millions attempts per second).\nAll of the above mentioned key-derivation algorithms (PBKDF2, Bcrypt, Scrypt and Argon2) are not patented and royalty-free for public use.\nLet's learn more about these modern KDF.\n"},"mac-and-key-derivation/pbkdf2.html":{"url":"mac-and-key-derivation/pbkdf2.html","title":"PBKDF2","keywords":"","body":"PBKDF2\nPBKDF2 is a simple cryptographic key derivation function, which is resistant to dictionary attacks and rainbow table attacks.

These functions derive a key (of fixed length) from a password (text) and need a lot memory (RAM), which does not allow fast parallel computations on GPU or ASIC hardware.\nAlgorithms like Bcrypt, Scrypt and Argon2 are considered more secure KDF functions.

For interactive login you most probably do not want to wait more than a 0.5 seconds, so the computations should be very slow. Also at the server side, it is usual that many users can login in the same time, so slow Scrypt computation will slow down the entire system.\nSample parameters for file encryption: N=1048576, r=8, p=1 (RAM = 1 GB). When you encrypt your hard drive, you will unlock the encrypted data in rare cases, usually not more than 2-3 times per day, so you may want to wait for 2-3 seconds to increase the security.\n\nYou can perform tests and choose the Scrypt parameters yourself during the design and development of your app or system. Always try to use the fastest possible implementation of Scrypt for your language and platform, because crackers will definitely use it. Some implementations (e.g. in Python) may be 100 times slower than the fastest ones!\nIn the MyEtherWallet crypto wallet, the default Scrypt parameters are N=8192, r=8, p=1.

It is similar for mobile apps, web services and other password-protected systems: all they need secure password storage (secure password management / strongly encrypted password storage).\nDevelopers often store the user passwords for their sites, apps or other systems in a database, just like any other user data, but most systems apply some kind of hashing, encryption or password authentication scheme. There are many ways to implement the password storage for password-based authentication. The most popular of them are given in the table below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApproach\nSecurity\nComments\n\n\nClear-text passwords\nExtremely low\nNever do this: compromised server will render all passwords leaked\n\n\nSimple password hash\nLow\nVulnerable to dictionary attacks\n\n\nSalted hashed passwords\nAverage\nVulnerable to GPU-based and ASIC-based password cracking\n\n\nSecure KDF function (like Argon2)\nHigh\nRecommended, use strong KDF parameters\n\n\n\nLet's review these password storage methods and discuss their level of security, their strong and weak sides.\nClear-Text Passwords - Never Do Anti-Pattern\nThe easiest and most highly insecure method for password storage and password-based authentication is to use clear-text passwords written directly in the database.\n\nIn this scenario to check the password, developers just compare the password for checking with the password from the database.\nNever do this!!! It is anti-pattern for software development. It is bad for many reasons.\nAdmins will be able to see user's passwords and this is really bad, because many users use the same password for several sites / apps, e.g. the same password for GMail, Facebook and Twitter.\nAdmins should never know user's passwords, but should be able to change them in case of emergency.\nIf someone hacks the server and gains access to the database, he will see all user's passwords in plaintext.\n\n\nIt is very bad practice to keep plaintext passwords in any information system / app in the world!\nJust don't do it!\n\n\n\nSimple Password Hash - Highly Insecure\nA relatively easy and relatively insecure method for password storage and password-based authentication is to use simple password hash like SHA-256(password), written directly in the database.\n\nIn this scenario to check the password, developers just compare the hash(password for checking) with the password hash from the database.\nAvoid this! It is highly insecure method.\nWhy? Because hashes are vulnerable to dictionary attacks.\nCrackers who gain access to the database, can use a dictionary holding the hashes of the most commonly used 10-20 million passwords and most of the passwords will be decrypted.\nThe dictionary attack process is extremely fast, because it compares the hashes from the dictionary with the password hash (trivial string compare).\nSearch in Internet for free dictionaries / wordlists for dictionary attack.\n\n\nCracked passwords, revealed as plaintext are a true disaster, because most users use the same password for several sites / apps.\n\nSalted Hashed Passwords - Secure, but Not Enough\nMore complicated and relatively secure method for password storage and password-based authentication is to use salted hashed passwords, written in the database as pair { salt + hash(password + salt) }. The hash function can be any strong cryptographic hash like SHA-256.\n\nThe idea is to keep different random salt, along with different password hash, changed every time, when the password is written in the database. Thus the same password is encrypted every time as different ciphertext { salt + hash }.\nTo check the password, developers calculate the hash(password for checking) using the salt from the database and compare the calculated hash with the hash from the database.\nThis method works well to prevent dictionary attacks, but does not prevent GPU-based and ASIC-based brute force password cracking attacks.\nIt has also the same security problems like using hash(key + msg) instead of HMAC(key, msg), e.g. length-extension attack.\nBasically keeping salted hashed passwords is more secure than the previous methods, but still avoid it.\nUse more attack-resistant password hashing function (which is unlikely to be brute-forced) instead of simple hash, e.g. Argon2 or Scrypt.\n\n\n\nSecure KDF-Based Password Hashing - Recommended\nThe most complicated and most secure method for secure password storage and password-based authentication is to use secure KDF-based password hash, written in the database as pair { salt + KDF(password, salt) }. The key-derivation function (KDF) should be strong and secure, e.g. Scrypt or Argon2 with carefully selected parameters.\n\nThe idea is to keep different random salt for each encrypted password, along with the key derived by a secure KDF-function, such as Scrypt or Argon2 (with reasonable number of iterations and RAM consumption settings).\nTo check the password, take the salt from the database and derive a key from the password for checking, using the same KDF function and KDF parameters like when the password was stored in the database. Compare the derived key with the key from the database.\nThis method is resistant to most attacks and is considered as standard in the software industry.\nIt is as secure as the KDF function with the selected KDF parameters. For example, Argon2 taking 128 MB RAM, 4 threads and 200 ms computing time) may be appropriate for the average case.\nCrackers cannot perform brute force attacks, because the password guessing will be too slow, even on a modern computer with good CPU and GPU or even using a specialized ASIC hardware.\n\n\n\nConclusion: use secure KDF functions like Argon2 and Scrypt to keep encrypted passwords in the database. Never use plain-text passwords!\nPassword-Based Authentication\nUsing a secure password storage is only one of the components of the process of secure password-based authentication for Web apps, mobile apps and Internet services. Systems, that use password-based-authentication are subject of many attacks:\n\nPassword guessing attack: attacker tries to guess / brute-force the user's password by attempting many logins in parallel.\nSolved easily by adding increasing login delay (wait time before the login is available again) after each wrong login attempt or even temporary account locking. Delays / locking should be done by IP address + username, to avoid login problems for the legitimate users.\nSecure KDF-based password storage delays the password guessing process, so it is highly recommended.\nUsing a CAPTCHA after a 2-3 unsuccessful login attempts provides quite good protection.\n\n\nDenial of service attack: attacker may attempt to login too many times to overload the system or can try to lock some user account with too many invalid login attempts for the same user.\nThe protection from this attack is similar to the previous attack: use a CAPTCHA and delay the login process for certain IP address after each login attempt.\n\n\nIntercept and replay attack: attacker may intercept the authentication communication (to sniff the login / password / auth ticket / other credentials) and use the intercepted credentials to login later.\nMost systems solve this problem by using TLS (encrypted connection) to securely send the authentication credentials (password / authentication ticket) to the server.\nOther solutions include challenge-response based cryptographic authentication scheme, such as the scheme used in the Kerberos) protocol.\n\n\nMan-in-the-middle attack: attacker can intercept and modify the intercepted traffic between the server and the client to trick the user to reveal its login credentials.\nThis is solved by using a TLS secure connection with server certificate, which authenticates the server.\nIn some scenarios (e.g. online banking) clients are also authenticated by a digital certificate or OTP (one-time password).\n\n\nCompromised server attack: if the authentication server and its database is compromised (hacked) and all its authentication data is leaked, the attacker should be unable to reveal user's plaintext passwords.\nFirst, it should be clear that if the authentication server is compromised, in all cases the attackers will get unauthorised access, because they will be able to intercept user's legitimate sessions (their login and communication after successful login) and use them to impersonate the user.\nUsing a strongly secure password storage mechanism mitigates the risk for users' passwords to be revealed as plaintext. Still, attackers who gain access to the authentication server may inject password interception backdoor) and steal each user's plaintext credentials (username + password) during the login.\nThe backdoored server attack can be stopped like this: the client generates a random number r and sends as authentication HMAC(password, r); the server compares the HMAC with its stored password. This process may be combined with client-side Scrypt or Argon2 computation and securely stored password at the server side (Scrypt or Argon2 hashed). In this scenario, unless the client software is not compromised, attackers who gained access to the authentication server will not obtain user's passwords in plaintext.\nIn Web applications, if the server is compromised it can inject JavaScript code to compromise the client itself. In desktop and mobiles apps, the client is more safe in case of compromised server.\n\n\n\nConclusions about how to implement a secure password-based authentication for Web sites, apps and services:\n\nUse secure password storage, such as Argon2 hash, with strong enough configuration settings.\nKeep your authentication server as secure as possible. If it is compromised, the entire system will be compromised.\nUse TLS or other secure communication channel between the authentication server and the client.\n\n"},"mac-and-key-derivation/exercises-password-encryption.html":{"url":"mac-and-key-derivation/exercises-password-encryption.html","title":"Exercises: Password Encryption","keywords":"","body":"Exercises: Password Encryption\nIn this exercise you will design a user authentication system for modern a Web or mobile app, following the industry's best practices.

In many algorithms, we need random (i.e. unpredictable) numbers. If these numbers are not unpredictable, the algorithms will be compromised.\nFor example, assume we need a secret key, that will protect our financial assets. This secret key should be randomly generated in a way that nobody else should be able to generate or have the same key. If we generate the key from a secure random generator, the it will be unpredictable and the system will be secure. Therefore \"secure random\" means simply \"unpredictable random\".\nLet's discuss in bigger detail the random numbers in computer science and their role in cryptography, as well as pseudo-random numbers generators (PRNG), secure pseudo-random generators (CSPRNG) and some guidelines about how developers should generate and use random numbers in their code.\nRandom Generators\nIn computer science random numbers usually come from a pseudo-random number generators (PRNG), initialized by some unpredictable initial randomness (entropy). In cryptography secure PRNGs are used, known as CSPRNG, which typically combined entropy with PRNG and other techniques to make the generated randomness unpredictable.\nPseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNG)\nA pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) is used to stretch a small amount of initial randomness\\\ninto a large amount of pseudorandomness, typically for use in cryptosystems. Note than PRNGs are not cryptographically secure and are different from CSPRNGs.\nPRNGs are functions that start from some initial entropy (seed) and calculate the next random number by some calculation which is unpredictable without knowing the seed. Such calculations are called pseudo-random functions.\n\nPseudo-random functions (which are not secure for cryptography) usually use an internal state. At the start, the state is initialized by an initial seed. When the next random number is generated, it is calculated from the internal state (using some computation or formula), then the internal state of the pseudo-random function is changed (using some computation or formula). When the next random number is generated, it is again calculated based on the internal state of the function and this state is again changed and so on.\nThis process in its simplest form can be implemented as follows:\ninit(entropy):\n  state = entropy, counter = 0\nnetNum():\n  state = HMAC(state, ++counter)\n  return state\n\nOf course, the HMAC function can be changed by some cryptographic hash function or another mathematical transformation like the Mersenne Twister (which is not cryptographically secure), but the main idea stays the same: pseudo-random generators have internal state, initialized with some initial randomness and over the time change their internal state and generate pseudo-random numbers, based on the current state.\nGood random number generators should be fast and should generate statistical randomness (see the Diehard tests), i.e. all numbers should have the same chance to be generated over the time. This is not sufficient cryptography, so CSPRNG have higher requirements.\nThe above idea to generate random pseudo-numbers based on HMAC(key + counter), with some complications, is known as the HMAC_DRGB algorithm, described in the security standard NIST 800-90A.\nInitial Entropy (Seed)\nTo be secure, a PRNG (which is statistically random) should start by a truly random initial seed, which is absolutely unpredictable. If the seed is predictable, it will generate predictable sequence of random numbers and the entire random generation process will be insecure. That's why having unpredictable randomness at the start (secure seed) is very important.\nHow to initialize the pseudo-random generator in a secure way? The answer is simple: collect randomness (entropy).\nEntropy\nIn computer science \"entropy\" means unpredictable randomness, and is usually measured in bits. For example, if you move your computer's mouse, it will generate some hard-to-predict events, like the start location and the end location of the mouse cursor. If we assume that the mouse has changed its position in the range of [0...255] pixels, the entropy collected from this mouse movement should be about 8 bits (because 2^8 = 255). Another example: if the user is asked to think of a number in the range [0...1000], this number will hold about 9-10 bits of entropy (because 2^10 = 1024). To collect 256 bits of entropy (e.g. to securely generate a 256-bit integer), you will need to take into account a sequence of several such events (like mouse movements and keyboard interracions from the user).\nCollecting Entropy\nEntropy can be collected from many hard-to-predict events in the computer: keyboard clicks, mouse moves, network activity, camera activity, microphone activity and others, combined with the time at which they occur. This collection of initial randomness is usually performed internally by the operating system (OS), which provides standard API to access it (e.g. reading from the /dev/random file in Linux). In desktop system, laptop or mobile phone entropy is easy to collect, while on some limited hardware devices (such as simple microcontrollers) entropy is hard or impossible to be collected.\nApplication software can collect entropy explicitly, by asking the user to move the mouse, type something at the keyboard, say something at the microphone or move in front of the camera for a while. A great example of this is the bitaddress.org wallet app, which combines mouse moves with keyboard events to collect entropy:\n\nOnce enough entropy is collected, it is used to initialize the random generator.\nInsecure Randomness\nInsecure / compromised randomness can compromise cryptography. A good example to learn from is the story of the stolen Bitcoins, due to broken random generator in Android: https://goo.gl/PFE1kr. That's why developers should care about randomness, when they use cryptography and ensure their random generators are secure.\nInsecure Randomness - Examples\nAs example how easy it is to compromise the random number security in Python (in its old versions), we shall give this code example:\nimport random\nprint(random.randrange(1000000, 9999999))\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/Random-in-Python.\nThe above code is assumed to generate a random number, but this number may be predictable. This is because the random library in Python (in its old versions) initializes the random generator seed by the current time. Thus, if you know the current time at the machine generating the random number (obviously you know this roughly), you will be able to predict the random seed and to predict the random numbers generated.\nTo better illustrate this, look at this more explicit example which generates two random 50-digit integers:\nimport random, time\n\nrandom.seed(time.time())\nr1 = random.randrange(1e49, 1e50-1)\n\nrandom.seed(time.time())\nr2 = random.randrange(1e49, 1e50-1)\n\nprint(r1)\nprint(r2)\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/Random-with-seed-in-Python.\nThe above code will print two equal numbers, both depending on the current time. It is obvious that the same time in the initial seed causes the same (predictable) pseudo-random numbers to be generated in the output. This is a sample output of the above code:\n53285353661739398833155340591358345604323255820576\n53285353661739398833155340591358345604323255820576\nIf you run this code through a debugger or in a slow environment, the produced numbers may be different, due to time change between the two random generation executions. Typically the Python interpreter at the interactive console produces two different numbers. To obtain the result, similar to the above, first save the code in a script file (e.g. insecure-rnd.py) and then execute the Python script file:\n\nBasically, when the initial random seed is initialized with a predictable number like the current time, crackers can try all possibilities within the range of +/- 5 seconds and find the exact initial seed and then compromise the security.\nRandomness and Cryptography\nRemember that cryptography cannot work without unpredictable randomness! If your random generator is compromised, it will generate predictable numbers and crackers will be able to decrypt your communication, reveal your private keys, tamper your digital signatures, etc. As a developer, you should always care how random numbers are generated in the cryptographic libraries you use.\nCSPRNG (Cryptography Secure Random Number Generators)\nBy definition CSPRNG (Cryptography Secure Random Number Generators) are a pseudo-random number generators (PRNG) with properties that make them suitable for use in cryptography. There are two major requirements for a PRNG to be a CSPRNG:\n\nSatisfy the next-bit test: if someone knows all k bits from the start of the PRNG, he would be unable to predict the bit k+1 using reasonable computing resources.\nWithstand the state compromise extensions: if an attacker guesses the internal state of the PRNG or it is revealed somehow, the attacker should be unable to reconstruct all previous random numbers prior to the revelation.\n\nThe entropy in the operating system is usually of limited amount and waiting for more entropy is slow and unpractical. Most cryptographic applications use CSPRNG, which \"stretch\" the available entropy from the operating system into more bits, required for cryptographic purposes and comply to the above CSPRNG requirements.\nMany design have been proposed to construct CSPRNG algorithms:\n\nCSPRNG based on secure block ciphers in counter mode, on stream ciphers or on secure secure hash functions.\nCSPRNG based on number theory, relying on the difficulty of the integer factorization problem (IFP), the discrete logarithm problem (DLP) or the elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP).\nCSPRNG based on special design for cryptographic secure randomness, such as Yarrow algorithm and Fortuna), which were used in MacOS and and FreeBSD.\n\nMost CSPRNG use a combination of entropy from the operating system and high-quality PRNG generator and they often \"reseed\", which means that when new entropy comes from the OS (e.g. from user input, system interruptions, disk I/O or hardware random generators), the underlying PRNG changes its internal state based on the new entropy bits coming. This constant reseeding over the time makes the CSPRNG really hard to predict and analyse.\nConclusion: Use Secure Random Generator\nAlways use cryptographically secure random generator libraries, like the java.security.SecureRandom in Java and the secrets library in Python:\nimport secrets\nprint(secrets.randbelow(int(1e50)))\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/Secrets-in-Python.\nThe above code does not depend on the current time and basically generates an unpredictable random number, based on the entropy collected by the operating system.\n"},"secure-random-generators/pseudo-random-numbers-examples.html":{"url":"secure-random-generators/pseudo-random-numbers-examples.html","title":"Pseudo-Random Numbers - Examples","keywords":"","body":"Pseudo-Random Numbers - Examples\nTo get a better idea how pseudo-random numbers are generated in computer programming, let's play with at the following Python code, which generates 5 pseudo-random numbers in the range [10...20]:\nimport hashlib, time\n\nstartSeed = str(time.time()) + '|'\nmin = 10\nmax = 20\nfor i in range(5):\n    nextSeed = startSeed + str(i)\n    hash = hashlib.sha256(nextSeed.encode('ascii')).digest()\n    bigRand = int.from_bytes(hash, 'big')\n    rand = min + bigRand % (max - min + 1)\n    print(nextSeed, bigRand, '-->', rand)\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/Pseudo-random-numbers-in-Python.\nThe above code produces time-depended (predictable) pseudo-random sequence:\n1539884529.7564313|0 80821949188459167822103620715837790870744533466506114260335306835341654043374 --> 20\n1539884529.7564313|1 74025479792630401388590516952955656999942018130178317853592496371994668720404 --> 12\n1539884529.7564313|2 82017697577161203981429946799250236982499988253633196542465974577893633076425 --> 18\n1539884529.7564313|3 107386997066995629290834465394867359239275712194747910247567090891223949362198 --> 13\n1539884529.7564313|4 83874630241630198317549470506043001102325518306912594861433838548293113930135 --> 10\nThe initial pseudo-random seed is taken from the current time. The first pseudo-random number in the sequence comes from the SHA-256 hash of the initial seed + the number 0, the second pseudo-random number comes from the hash of the initial seed + the number 1 and so on. To get an output of certain range [min...max] the 256-bit hash is divided to (max - min + 1) and min is added to it. The number i, together with the value startSeed hold the internal state of the random generator, which changes for each next random number.\nThe above pseudo-random generator is based on the random statistical distribution of the SHA-256 function. It is expected that the chance for each possible number to be generated is equal.\nCreating a Secure Random Generator\nThe above random generator is not secure, because it is not initialized by an unpredictable source of entropy. Let's fix this.\nWe shall initialize the initial randomness based on the keyboard events. The user will be asked to enter something 5 times and the exact precise times of the moments of the user input, together with the data entered from the user will be joined as initial randomness (seed). The collected text entropy can be shortened through SHA-256 hashing (this will reduce it to 256 bits). After the entropy is collected and the start seed is calculated, the same logic like at the previous example will be used to generate 5 random numbers in the range [10...20]. This is a sample Python implementation:\nimport hashlib, time, binascii\n\nentropy = ''\nfor i in range(5):\n    s = input(\"Enter something [\" + str(i+1) + \" of 5]: \")\n    entropy = entropy + s + '|' + str(time.time()) + '|'\nprint(\"Entropy:\", entropy)\nstartSeed = str(binascii.hexlify(hashlib.sha256(entropy.encode('ascii')).digest()))[2:-1]\nprint(\"Start seed = SHA-256(entropy) =\", startSeed)\n\nmin = 10\nmax = 20\nfor i in range(5):\n    nextSeed = startSeed + '|' + str(i)\n    hash = hashlib.sha256(nextSeed.encode('ascii')).digest()\n    bigRand = int.from_bytes(hash, 'big')\n    rand = min + bigRand % (max - min + 1)\n    print(nextSeed, bigRand, '-->', rand)\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/secure-random-generator-in-Python.\nA sample output from the above code may look like this:\nEnter something [1 of 5]: first\nEnter something [2 of 5]: second\nEnter something [3 of 5]: random text\nEnter something [4 of 5]: dfasfdasfs\nEnter something [5 of 5]: last\nEntropy: first|1539885709.4494743|second|1539885713.687703|random text|1539885721.5754962|dfasfdasfs|1539885724.40904|last|1539885726.1286101|\nStart seed = SHA-256(entropy) = f8a4eaceb16156b1a23f4b6d08e54665ffa4822949b22e01d6de4c5daae965e3\nf8a4eaceb16156b1a23f4b6d08e54665ffa4822949b22e01d6de4c5daae965e3|0 84482770259566839097936866229004786554948913905882724148636325987196754263481 --> 19\nf8a4eaceb16156b1a23f4b6d08e54665ffa4822949b22e01d6de4c5daae965e3|1 67001454659030164457342421011672033052466168976555224352709830050538321411120 --> 14\nf8a4eaceb16156b1a23f4b6d08e54665ffa4822949b22e01d6de4c5daae965e3|2 103739181507291072572315034266940107849472122762876847172454548630886082729227 --> 12\nf8a4eaceb16156b1a23f4b6d08e54665ffa4822949b22e01d6de4c5daae965e3|3 3011033199204097839903859902789759740091959530467456042709372597822032778153 --> 16\nf8a4eaceb16156b1a23f4b6d08e54665ffa4822949b22e01d6de4c5daae965e3|4 100466094724924763659843669256673300207383922129676800217664465341535622195997 --> 16\nNote that the collected entropy is very hard to be predicted.

CSPRNG satisfy the next-bit test and withstand the state compromise extensions and are typically part of the operating system or come from secure external source. Depending on the level of security required, CSPRNG can be implemented as software components or as hardware devices or as combination of both.\nFor example, in the credit card printing centers the formal security regulations require certified hardware random generators to be used to generate credit card PIN codes, private keys and other data, designed to remain private.\nModern operating systems (OS) collect entropy (initial seed) from the environmental noise: keyboard clicks, mouse moves, network activity, system I/O interruptions, hard disk activity, etc. Sources of randomness from the environment in Linux, for example, include inter-keyboard timings, inter-interrupt timings from some interrupts, and other events which are both non-deterministic and hard to measure for an outside observer.\nThe collected in the OS randomness is usually accessible from /dev/random and /dev/urandom.\n\nReading from the /dev/random file (the limited blocking random generator) returns entropy from the kernel's entropy pool (collected noise) and blocks when the entropy pool is empty until additional environmental noise is gathered.\nReading the /dev/urandom file (the unlimited non-blocking random generator) returns entropy from the kernel's entropy pool or a pseudo-random data, generated from previously collected environmental noise, which is also unpredictable, but is based on secure entropy \"stretching\" algorithm.\n\nUsually a CSPRNG should start from an unpredictable random seed from the operating system, from a specialized hardware or from external source. Random numbers after the seed initialization are typically produces by a pseudo-random computation, but this does not compromise the security. Most algorithms often \"reseed\" the CSPRNG random generator when a new entropy comes, to make their work even more unpredictable.\nTypically modern OS CSPRNG APIs combine the constantly collected entropy from the environment with the internal state of their built-in pseudo-random algorithm with continuous reseeding to guarantee maximal unpredictability of the generated randomness with high speed and non-blocking behavior in the same time.\nHardware Random Generators (TRNG)\nHardware random generators, known as true random number generators (TRNG), typically capture physical processes or phenomenа, such as the visible spectrum of the light, the thermal noise from the environment, the atmosphere noise, etc. The randomness from the physical environment is collected through specialized sensors, then amplified and processed by the device and finally transmitted to the computer through USB, PCI Express or other standard interface.\nModern microprocessors (CPU) ****provide a built-in hardware random generator, accessible through a special CPU instruction RdRand, which return a random integer into one of the CPU registers.\nMost cryptographic applications today do not require a hardware random generator, because the entropy in the operating system is secure enough for general cryptographic purposes. Using a TRNG is needed for systems with higher security requirements, such as banking and finance applications, certification authorities and high volume payment processors.\nHow as a Developer to Access the CSPRNG?\nTypically developers access the cryptographically strong random number generators (CSPRNG) for their OS from a cryptography library for their language and platform.\n\nIn Linux and macOS, it is considered that both /dev/random and /dev/urandom sources of randomness are secure enough for most cryptographic purposes and most cryptographic libraries access them internally.\nIn Windows, random numbers for cryptographic purposes can be securely generated using the BCryptGenRandom function from the Cryptography API: Next Generation (CNG) or higher level crypto libraries.\nIn C# use System.Security.Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator.Create() from .NET Framework or .NET Core.\nIn Python use os.urandom() or the secrets library.\nIn Java use the java.security.SecureRandom system class.\nIn JavaScript use window.crypto.getRandomValues(Uint8Array) for client side (in the Web browser) or crypto.randomBytes() or external module like node-sodium for server-side (in Node.js).\n\nNever use Math.random() or similar insecure RNG functions for cryptographic purposes!\n"},"secure-random-generators/exercises-pseudo-random-generator.html":{"url":"secure-random-generators/exercises-pseudo-random-generator.html","title":"Exercises: Pseudo-Random Generator","keywords":"","body":"Exercises: Pseudo-Random Generator\nWrite a code to generate 30 pseudo-random integers in the range [1...10], starting from certain entropy, taken as input, using HMAC key derivation.\nFrom the entropy generate a seed (256-bit binary sequence) using SHA-256:\nseed = SHA256(entropy)\n\nGenerate the n-th random number by the formula:\n1 + HMAC-SHA256(n, seed) % 10\n\nPrint the numbers at the output, separated by space.\nSample input and corresponding output:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\nhello\n8 4 10 5 5 3 5 7 10 6 4 9 2 3 2 8 3 3 10 6 8 10 9 10 1 3 6 4 4 10\n\n\nrandom text\n10 5 5 9 7 4 2 9 2 1 10 4 8 9 8 1 8 6 5 7 5 4 3 4 6 6 9 8 1 1\n\n\nfun\n6 5 9 2 2 5 1 6 10 10 10 1 8 10 6 9 2 1 5 10 1 4 8 5 6 3 8 4 2 1\n\n\n\n"},"key-exchange/":{"url":"key-exchange/","title":"Key Exchange and DHKE","keywords":"","body":"Key Exchange and DHKE\nIn cryptography key establishment (key exchange, key negotiation) is a process or protocol, whereby a shared secret becomes available to two parties, for subsequent cryptographic use, typically for encrypted communication. Establishment techniques can be key agreement or key transport schemes.\n\nIn a key agreement scheme both parties contribute to the negotiation of the shared secret. Examples of key agreement schemes are Diffie-Hellman (DHKE) and Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH).\nIn a key transport scheme only one of the parties contributes to the shared secret and the other party obtains the secret from it. Key transport schemes are typically implemented through public-key cryptography, e.g. in the RSA key exchange the client encrypts a random session key by its private key and sends it to the server, where it is decrypted using the client's public key.\n\nBy design key exchange schemes securely exchange cryptographic keys between two parties, in a way that noone else can obtain a copy of the keys. Typically, at the start of an encrypted conversation (e.g. during the TLS handshake phase), the parties first negotiate about the encryption keys (the shared secret) to be used during the conversation. Key exchange schemes are really important topic in the modern cryptography, because keys are exchanged hundreds of times by million devices and servers in Internet.\nA key negotiation (key establishment) scheme is executed every time when a laptop connects to the Wi-Fi network or a Web browser opens a Web site through the https:// protocol. The key negotiation can be based on a annonymous key-exchange protocol (like DHKE), a password or pre-shared key (PSK), a digital certificate or a combination of many elements together. Some communication protocols establish a shared secret key once only, while others constantly change the secret key over the time.\nAuthenticated Key Exchange (AKE) is the exchange of session key in a key exchange protocol which also authenticates the identities of the involved parties (e.g. through a password, public key or digital certificate). For example, if you connect to a password-protected WiFi network, an authenticated key agreement protocol is used, in most cases password-authenticated key agreement (PAKE). If you connect to a public WiFi network, anonymous key agreement is conducted.\nKey Exchange / Key Agreement Algorithms\nMany cryptographic algorithms exist for key exchange and key establishment. Some use public-key cryptosystems, others use simple key-exchange schemes (like the Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange), some involve server authentication, some involve client authentication, some use passwords, some use digital certificates or other authentication mechanisms.\nExamples of key exchange schemes are: Diffie–Hellman key exchange (DHКЕ) and Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH), RSA-OAEP and RSA-KEM (RSA key transport), PSK (pre-shared key), SRP (Secure Remote Password protocol), FHMQV (Fully Hashed Menezes-Qu-Vanstone), ECMQV (Ellictic-Curve Menezes-Qu-Vanstone) and CECPQ1 (quantum-safe key agreement).\nLet's start from the classical Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange (DHКЕ) scheme, which was one of the first public key protocols.\n"},"key-exchange/diffie-hellman-key-exchange.html":{"url":"key-exchange/diffie-hellman-key-exchange.html","title":"Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange","keywords":"","body":"Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange\nDiffie–Hellman Key Exchange (DHKE)\nDiffie–Hellman Key Exchange (DHKE) is a cryptographic method to securely exchange cryptographic keys (key agreement protocol) over a public (insecure) channel in a way that overheard communication does not reveal the keys. The exchanged keys are used later for encrypted communication (e.g. using a symmetric cipher like AES).\nDHKE was one of the first public-key protocols, which allows two parties to exchange data securely, so that is someone sniffs the communication between the parties, the information exchanged can be revealed.\nThe Diffie–Hellman (DH) method is anonymous key agreement scheme: it allows two parties that have no prior knowledge of each other to jointly establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel.\nNote that the DHKE method is resistant to sniffing attacks (data interception), but it is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks (attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communication between two parties).\nThe Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange protocol can be implemented using discrete logarithms (the classical DHKE algorithm) or using elliptic-curve cryptography (the ECDH algorithm).\nKey Exchange by Mixing Colors\nThe Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange protocol is very similar to the concept of \"key exchanging by mixing colors\", which has a good visual representation, which simplifies its understanding. This is why we shall first explain how to exchange a secret color by color mixing.\nThe design of color mixing key exchange scheme assumes that if we have two liquids of different colors, we can easily mix the colors and obtain a new color, but the reverse operation is almost impossible: no way to separate the mixed colors back to their original color components.\nThis is the color exchange scenario, step by step:\n\nAlice and Bob, agree on an arbitrary starting (shared) color that does not need to be kept secret (e.g. yellow).\nAlice and Bob separately select a secret color that they keep to themselves (e.g. red and sea green).\nFinally Alice and Bob mix their secret color together with their mutually shared color. The obtained mixed colors area ready for public exchange (in our case orange and light sky blue).\n\n\nThe next steps in the color exchanging scenario are as follows:\n\nAlice and Bob publicly exchange their two mixed colors.\nWe assume that there is no efficient way to extract (separate) the secret color from the mixed color, so third parties who know the mixed colors cannot reveal the secret colors.\n\n\nFinally, Alice and Bob mix together the color they received from the partner with their own secret color.\nThe result is the final color mixture (yellow-brown) which is identical to the partner's color mixture.\nIt is the securely exchanged shared key.\n\n\n\n\nIf a third parties have intercepted the color exchanging process, it would be computationally difficult for them to determine the secret colors.\nThe Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange protocol is based on similar concept, but uses discrete logarithms and modular exponentiations instead of color mixing.\nThe Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (DHKE) Protocol\nNow, let's explain how the DHKE protocol works.\nThe Math behind DHKE\nDHKE is based on a simple property of modular exponentiations:\n(ga)b mod p = (gb)a mod p\nwhere g, a, b and p are positive integers.\nIf we have A = ga mod p and B = gb mod p, we can calculate gab mod p, without revealing a or b (which are called secret exponents).\nIn computing theory, these is no efficient algorithm which can find a secret exponent. If we have m, g and p from the below equation:\nm = gs mod p\nthere is no efficient (fast) algorithm to find the secret exponent s. This is known as the Discrete Logartihm Problem (DLP)).\nDiscrete Logarithm Problem (DLP)\nThe Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP) in computer science is defined as follows:\n\nBy given element b and value a = bx find the exponent x (if it exists)\n\nThe exponent x is called discrete logarithm, i.e. x = logb(a). The elements a and b can be simple integers modulo p (from the group ℤ/pℤ) or elements of finite cyclic multiplicative group G (modulo p), where p is typically a prime number.\nIn cryptography, many algorithms rely on the computational difficulty of the DLP problem over carefully chosen group, for which no efficient algorithm exists.\nThe DHKE Protocol\nNow, after we are familiar with the above mathematical properties of the modular exponentiations, we are ready to explain the DHKE protocol. This is how it works:\n\nLet's explain each step of this key-exchange process:\n\nAlice and Bob agree to use two public integers: modulus p and base g (where p is prime, and g is a primitive root modulo p).\nFor example, let p = 23 and g = 5.\nThe integers g and p are public, typically hard-coded constants in the source code.\n\n\nAlice chooses a secret integer a (e.g. a = 4), then calculates and sends to Bob the number A = ga mod p.\nThe number A is public. It is sent over the public channel and its interception cannot reveal the secret exponent a.\nIn our case we have: A = 54 mod 23 = 4.\n\n\nBob chooses a secret integer b (e.g. b = 3), then calculates and sends to Alice the number B = gb mod p.\nIn our case we have: B = 53 mod 23 = 10\n\n\nAlice computes s = Ba mod p\nIn our example: s = 104 mod 23 = 18\n\n\nBob computes s = Ab mod p\nIn our example: s = 43 mod 23 = 18\n\n\nAlice and Bob now share a secret number s\ns = Ab mod p = Ba mod p = (ga)b mod p = (gb)a mod p = gab mod p = 18\nThe shared secret key s cannot be computed from the publicly available numbers A and B, because the secret exponents a and b cannot be efficiently calculated.\n\n\n\nIn the most common implementation of DHKE (following the RFC 3526) the base is g = 2 and the modulus p is a large prime number (1536 ... 8192 bits).\nSecurity of the DHKE Protocol\nThe DHKE protocol is based on the practical difficulty of the Diffie–Hellman problem, which is a variant of the well known in the computer science DLP (discrete logarithm problem)), for which no efficient algorithm still exists.\nDHKE exchanges a non-secret sequence of integer numbers over insecure, public (sniffable) channel (such as signal going through a cable or propagated by waves in the air), but does not reveal the secretly-exchanged shared private key.\nAgain, be warned that DHKE protocol in its classical form is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, where a hacker can intercept and modify the messages exchanged between the parties.\nFinally, note that the integers g, p, a and p are typically very big numbers (1024, 2048 or 4096 bits or even bigger) and this makes the brute-force attacks non-sense.\nDHKE - Live Example\nAs live example, you can play with this online DHKE tool: http://www.irongeek.com/diffie-hellman.php\n\nECDH - Elliptic Curves-based Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Protocol\nThe Elliptic-Curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) is an anonymous key agreement protocol that allows two parties, each having an elliptic-curve public–private key pair, to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel.\nECDH is a variant of the classical DHKE protocol, where the modular exponentiation calculations are replaced with elliptic-curve calculations for improved security. We shall explain in details the elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) section later.\n"},"key-exchange/dhke-examples.html":{"url":"key-exchange/dhke-examples.html","title":"DHKE - Examples","keywords":"","body":"DHKE - Examples\nLet's give a simple code example in Python to demonstrate the classical Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange (DHKE) algorithm.\nFirst, install the Python package PyDHE:\npip install pyDHE\n\nNext, write the code for the DHKE example:\nimport pyDHE\n\nalice = pyDHE.new()\nalicePubKey = alice.getPublicKey()\nprint(\"Alice public key:\", hex(alicePubKey))\n\nbob = pyDHE.new()\nbobPubKey = bob.getPublicKey()\nprint(\"Bob public key:\", hex(bobPubKey))\n\nprint(\"Now exchange the public keys (e.g. through Internet)\")\n\naliceSharedKey = alice.update(bobPubKey)\nprint(\"Alice shared key:\", hex(aliceSharedKey))\n\nbobSharedKey = bob.update(alicePubKey)\nprint(\"Bob shared key:\", hex(bobSharedKey))\n\nprint(\"Equal shared keys:\", aliceSharedKey == bobSharedKey)\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/Diffie-Hellman-Key-Exchange-in-Python.\nWhen you run the above code, it will generate and print two 2048-bit public keys (for Alice and for Bob).

Exchange\n...\nTODO\n...\n"},"encryption-symmetric-and-asymmetric.html":{"url":"encryption-symmetric-and-asymmetric.html","title":"Encryption: Symmetric and Asymmetric","keywords":"","body":"Encryption: Symmetric and Asymmetric\nIn cryptography two major types of encryption schemes are widely used: symmetric encryption (where a single secret key is used to encrypt and decrypt data) and asymmetric encryption (where a public key cryptosystem is used and encryption and decryption is done using a pair of public and corresponding private key). Let's explain these fundamental crypto-concepts in details.\nSymmetric Encryption - Concepts and Algorithms\nSymmetric encryption schemes use the same symmetric key (or password) to encrypt data and decrypt the encrypted data back to its original form:\n\nSymmetric encryption usually combines several crypto algorithms into an symmetric encryption scheme, e.g. AES-256-CTR-HMAC-SHA256. The encryption scheme (cipher construction) may include: password to key derivation algorithm (with certain parameters) + symmetric cipher algorithm (with certain parameters) + cipher block mode algorithm + message authentication (MAC) algorithm. This means that the above shown diagram is simplified and does not fully represent the process.\nSecret Keys\nThe secret key used to cipher (encrypt) and decipher (decrypt) data is typically of size 128, 192 or 256 bits and is sometimes referred as \"encryption key\" or \"shared key\", because both sending and receiving parties should know it.\nMost applications use a password-to-key-derivation scheme to extract a secret key from certain password, because users tend to remember passwords easier than binary data. Additionally, message authentication is often incorporated along with the encryption to provide integrity and authenticity (this encryption approach is known as \"authenticated encryption\").\nHow does a private key look like? Let's start from a simple example of 256-bit secret key, encoded as hex string:\n02c324648931b89e3e8a0fc42c96e8e3be2e42812986573a40d46563bceaf75110\nIn many systems (e.g. public blockchains, PGP, OpenSSL and others) secret keys are encoded as base58 or base64 for shorter string representation.\nFor example, the above key looks like this in base58:\npbPRqYDxnKZfs8j4KKiqYmx6nzipAjTJf1oCD1WKgy99\nThe same key looks like this in base64:\nAsMkZIkxuJ4+ig/ELJbo474uQoEphlc6QNRlY7zq91EQ\nIn decimal system, the above key is the following integer number:\n319849484316084980661994213716306415989897600164422912728298459349458028548368\nModern Symmetric Encryption Algorithms\nWidely used in modern cryptography symmetric encryption algorithms (ciphers) are: AES (AES-128, AES-192, AES-256), ChaCha20, Twofish, IDEA, Serpent), Camelia) and others. Most of them are block ciphers (encrypt data by blocks of fixed size, e.g. 128 bits), while others are stream ciphers (encrypt data byte by byte as a stream). Block ciphers can be turned into stream ciphers by using a technique called \"cipher block mode\".\nWe shall give more details and code examples using the AES and ChaCha20 algorithms a bit later.\nSymmetric Encryption - Online Demo\nIn order to better understand the idea behind the symmetric encryption, you can play with some online symmetric encryption tool to encrypt and decrypt a sample message by sample secret key (or password). You can play a bit with this site: https://aesencryption.net.\n\nIt demonstrates how we can encrypt and decrypt messages, using the AES cipher (with certain settings, more precisely AES-128-CBC) and certain password-to-key-derivation function. In the above example if we encrypt the text \"secret msg\" by the password \"p@ss\", we will get the base64-encoded binary data \"jVJwOBmH+qMqHdg22KwMyg==\" as output. After decryption with the same secret key we get back the original text \"secret msg\".\nNote that the above encrypted text is dependent to many algorithm parameters and settings, so if you encrypt the same at another \"AES live example\" Web site, the result most likely will be different.\nAlso note that the above mentioned Web site uses bad practices, old algorithms and weak cipher settings, so don't follow the code examples there.\nPublic Key Cryptography - Concepts\nBefore introducing the asymmetric key encryption schemes and algorithms, we should first understand the concept of public key cryptography (asymmetric cryptography).\nThe public key cryptography uses a different key to encrypt and decrypt data (or to sign and verify messages). Keys always come as public + private key pairs. Asymmetric cryptography deals with encrypting and decrypting messages using a public / private key, signing messages, verifying signatures and securely exchanging keys.\nPopular public-key cryptosystems (asymmetric crypto algorithms) like RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman), ECC (elliptic curve cryptography), Diffie-Hellman, ECDH, ECDSA and EdDSA, are widely used in the modern cryptography and we shall demonstrate most of them in practice with code examples.\nPublic Key Encryption / Decryption\nAsymmetric encryption schemes use a pair of cryptographically related public and private keys to encrypt the data (by the public key) and decrypt the encrypted data back to its original forms (by the private key). Data encrypted by a public key is decrypted by the corresponding private key:\n\nThe encrypted data, obtained as result of encryption is called \"ciphertext\". The ciphertext is a binary sequence, unreadable by humans and by design cannot be decrypted without the decryption key.\n\nNote that the above shown diagram is highly simplified and does not fully represent the asymmetric encryption / decryption process. Typically, public-key cryptosystems can encrypt messages of limited length only and are slower than symmetric ciphers. For encrypting longer messages (e.g. PDF documents) usually a public-key encryption scheme (also known as hybrid encryption scheme) is used, which combines symmetric and asymmetric encryption like this:\n\nFor the encryption a random symmetric key sk is generated, the message is symmetrically encrypted by sk, then sk is asymmetrically encrypted using the recipient's public key.\nFor decryption, first the sk key is asymmetrically decrypted using the recipient's private key, then the ciphertext is decrypted symmetrically using sk.\n\nThe above process is known as key encapsulation mechanism (KEM): encapsulate an asymmetrically-encrypted random (ephemeral) symmetric key and use symmetric algorithm for the data encryption.\nPublic key encryption can work also in the opposite scenario: encrypt data by a private key and decrypt it by the public key. Thus someone can prove that he is owner of certain private key, while revealing only its corresponding public key. This approach is used by some digital signature schemes.\nSignatures: Asymmetric Signing / Verification\nIn the context of digital signatures, a message signed by a private key (digital signature) is later verified by the corresponding public key.\n\nDigital signatures will be explained in more details later, but in short: a message can be signed by certain private key and the obtained signature can be later verified by the corresponding public key. A signed message cannot be altered after signing. A message signature proves that certain message (e.g. blockchain transaction) is created by the owner of certain public key. Digital signatures provide message authentication, message integrity and non-repudiation.\nDigital signatures are widely used in the finance industry for authorizing payments. In operating systems OS components and device drivers are usually digitally signed to avoid injecting insecure code, trojans or viruses in the OS. In blockchain systems, transactions are typically signed by the owner of certain blockchain address (which corresponds to certain public key and has corresponding private key). So a signed blockchain transaction holds a proof of authorship: it is guaranteed mathematically that the signature is created by the holder of certain blockchain address and the transaction was not modified after the signing. This works perfectly for the scenario of digital payments and digital signing of documents and contracts.\nKey Pairs\nThe public key cryptography uses a pair of keys: public key + private key. These keys are mathematically connected and are used together as pair.\nIn some public key cryptosystems (like the Elliptic-Curve Cryptography - ECC), the public key can be calculated from the private key. In other cryptosystems (like RSA), the public key and the private key are generated together but cannot be directly calculated from each other.\nUsually, a public / private key pair is randomly generated in a secure environment (e.g. in a hardware wallet) and the public key is revealed, while the private key is securely stored in a crypto-wallet and is protected by a password or by multi-factor authentication.\nExample of 256-bit private key and its corresponding 256-bit public key (based on secp256k1 curve):\nprivKey: 648fc1fa828c7f185d825c04a5b21af9e473b867eeee1acea4dbab938433e158\npubKey: 02c324648931b89e3e8a0fc42c96e8e3be2e42812986573a40d46563bceaf75110\nPrivate Keys\nMessage encryption and signing is done by a private key. The private keys are always kept secret by their owner, just like passwords. In the server infrastructure, private key usually stay in an encrypted and protected keystore. In the blockchain systems the private keys usually stay in specific software or hardware apps or devices called \"crypto wallets\", which store securely a set of private keys.\nExample of 256-bit private key:\n648fc1fa828c7f185d825c04a5b21af9e473b867eeee1acea4dbab938433e158\nPublic Keys\nMessage decryption and signature verification is done by the public key. Public keys are by design public information (not a secret). It is mathematically infeasible to calculate the private key from its corresponding public key.\nIn many systems the public key is encapsulated in a digital certificate, which binds certain identity (e.g. person or Internet domain name) to certain public key. In blockchain systems public keys are usually published as parts of the blockchain transactions to help identify who has signed each transaction. In systems like PGP and SSH the public key is downloaded from the server once (after manual user verification) and is remembered for further use.\nExample of 256-bit public key:\n02c324648931b89e3e8a0fc42c96e8e3be2e42812986573a40d46563bceaf75110\nIn most blockchain systems the blockchain address is derived from the public key (by hashing and other transformations), so if you have someone's public key, you are assumed to have his blockchain address as well.\nA certain public key can be connected to certain person or organization or is used anonymously. You can never know who is the owner of the private key, corresponding to certain public key, unless you have additional proof, e.g. a digital certificate.\nPopular Public Key Cryptosystems\nPublic key cryptosystems provide mathematical framework and algorithms to generate public + private key pairs, to sign, verify, encrypt and decrypt messages and exchange keys, in a cryptographically secure way.\nWell-known public-key cryptosystems are: RSA), ECC and ElGamal. Many crypto algorithms are based on the primitives from these cryptosystems like RSA sign, RSA encrypt / decrypt, ECDH key exchange and ECDSA and EdDSA signatures.\nThe RSA Cryptosystem\nThe RSA public-key cryptosystem) is based on the math of modular exponentiations (numbers raised to a power by modulus) and some additional assumptions, together with the computational difficulty of the integer factorization problem. We shall discuss it later in details, along with examples.\nThe ECC Cryptosystem\nThe elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) public-key cryptosystem is based on the math of the on the algebraic structure of the elliptic curves over finite fields and the difficulty of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP). The ECC usually comes together with the ECDSA algorithm (elliptic-curve digital signature algorithm). We shall discuss ECC and ECDSA in details, along with examples.\nECC is Recommended in the General Case\nECC uses smaller keys, ciphertexts and signatures than RSA and is recommended for most applications. It is mathematically proven that a 3072-bit RSA key has similar cryptographic strength to a 256-bit ECC key. Key generation is in ECC is significantly faster than with RSA.\nDue to the above reasons most blockchain networks (like Bitcoin and Ethereum) use elliptic-curve-based cryptography (ECC) to secure the transactions.\nNote that both RSA and ECC cryptosystems are not quantum-safe, which means that if someone has enough powerful quantum computer, he will be able to derive the private key from given public key in just few seconds.\nAsymmetric Encryption in Practice\nAsymmetric encryption works for small messages only (limited by the public / private key length). To encrypt larger messages key encapsulation mechanisms or other techniques can be used, which encrypt asymmetrically a random secret key, then use it to symmetrically encrypt the larger messages. In practice, modern asymmetric encryption schemes involve using a symmetric encryption algorithm together with a public-key cryptosystem, key encapsulation and message authentication.\nPopular asymmetric encryption schemes are: RSA-OAEP (based on RSA and OAEP padding), RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5 (based on RSA and PKCS#1 v1.5 padding), DLIES (based on discrete logarithms and symmetric encryption) and ECIES (based on elliptic curve cryptography and symmetric encryption).\nAsymmetric Encryption - Online Demo\nIn order to better understand the idea behind the asymmetric encryption, you can play with some online public key encryption tool to encrypt / decrypt a sample message by sample RSA private / public key. You can play a bit with this site: http://travistidwell.com/jsencrypt/demo/.\n\nIn the above online demo you can generate RSA public / private key pairs and encrypt / decrypt text messages. Note that the message size is limited by the key length, so you can't encrypt long text. You will get an error if you try. Internally, the above Web site uses the RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5 public key encryption scheme as specified in RFC3447.\nWe shall discuss the RSA and ECC cryptosystems in details in the next few chapters. Now, it is important to learn that symmetric and asymmetric cryptosystems work differently and are used in different scenarios.\n"},"symmetric-key-ciphers/":{"url":"symmetric-key-ciphers/","title":"Symmetric Key Ciphers","keywords":"","body":"Symmetric Key Ciphers\nSymmetric key ciphers (like AES, ChaCha20, RC6, Twofish, CAST and many others) use the same key (or password) to encrypt and decrypt data. They are often used in combination with other algorithms into a symmetric encryption schemes (like ChaCha20-Poly1305 and AES-128-GCM and AES-256-CTR-HMAC-SHA256), often with password to key derivation algorithms (like Scrypt and Argon2). Symmetric key ciphers are quantum-resistant, which means that powerful quantum computers will not be able to break their security (when big enough key lengths are used). Symmetric ciphers can encrypt data coming as blocks of fixed size (block ciphers) or data coming as a sequence of bytes (stream ciphers). Block ciphers can be transformed to stream ciphers by certain constructions, known as \"block cipher modes of operation\".\nSymmetric Encryption / Decryption\nSymmetric encryption and decryption uses a secret key or passphrase (to derive the key from it). The secret key used to encrypt and decrypt the data is usually 128 bits or 256 bits and is called \"encryption key\". Sometimes it is given as hex or base64-encoded integer number or is derived through a password-to-key derivation scheme.\nWhen the input data is encrypted, it is transformed to encrypted ciphertext and when the ciphertext is decrypted, it is transformed back to the original input data.\n\nSymmetric Encryption Uses a Set of Algorithms\nIt is important to know as a concept that symmetric-key encryption algorithms usually do not work standalone. They work together with other related crypto algorithms, into a symmetric encryption scheme / symmetric encryption construction.\nIn most encryption schemes an encryption is combined with password to key derivation algorithm and message authentication scheme (see authenticated encryption). Typically a symmetric encryption procedure uses a sequence of steps, involving different crypto algorithms:\n\nPassword-to-key derivation algorithm (like Scrypt or Argon2): to allow using a password instead of a key and to make password cracking hard and slow to be performed.\nBlock to stream cipher transformation algorithm (block cipher mode like CBC or CTR) + message padding algorithm like PKCS7 (in some modes): to allow encrypting data of arbitrary size using a block cipher algorithm (like AES).\nBlock cipher algorithm (like AES): to securely encrypt data blocks of fixed length using a secret key.\nMessage authentication algorithm (like HMAC): to check whether after decryption the obtained result matches the original message before the encryption.\n\nLater in this section we shall give more details and examples about how to configure and use symmetric block ciphers (like AES) along with the all above described algorithms to securely encrypt and decrypt messages of arbitrary size.\n"},"symmetric-key-ciphers/cipher-block-modes.html":{"url":"symmetric-key-ciphers/cipher-block-modes.html","title":"Cipher Block Modes","keywords":"","body":"Cipher Block Modes\nIn cryptography block ciphers (like AES) are designed to encrypt a block of data of fixed size (e.g. 128 bits). The size of the input block is usually the same as the size of the encrypted output block, while the key length may be different.\nStream ciphers are more flexible: they are designed to encrypt data of arbitrary size (e.g. a PDF document), that may sometimes come as a stream (sequence of bytes or frames, e.g. video streaming).\nMost of the popular symmetric key encryption algorithms are block ciphers, but cryptographers have proposed several schemes to transform a block cipher into a stream cipher and encrypt data of arbitrary size. These schemes are known as \"block cipher modes of operation\" and are applicable for most block ciphers like AES, RC6, Camellia, Serpent and many others.\nWhen a symmetric cipher is combined with block mode of operation, the obtained cipher construction is denoted by the names of the cipher and the block mode and the key size. Examples:\n\nAES-256-GCM - the AES cipher with a 256-bit encryption key and GCM block mode\nAES-128-CTR - the AES cipher with a 128-bit encryption key and CTR block mode\nSerpent-128-CBC - the Serpent cipher with 128-bit encryption key and CBC block mode\n\nBlock Cipher Modes (CBC, CTR, GCM, ...)\nThe main idea behind the block cipher modes (like CBC, CFB, OFB, CTR, EAX, CCM and GCM) is to repeatedly apply a cipher's single-block encryption / decryption to securely encrypt / decrypt amounts of data larger than a block.\nSome block modes (like CBC) require the input to be split into blocks and the final block to be padded to the block size using a padding algorithm (e.g. add a special padding character). Other block modes (like CTR, CFB, OFB, CCM, EAX and GCM) do not require padding at all, because they perform XOR between portions of the plaintext and the internal cipher's state at each step.\nBasically, encrypting a large input data works like this: the encryption algorithm state is initialized (using the encryption key + a random salt), then the first portion of data (e.g. a block or part of block) is encrypted, then the encryption state is transformed (using the encryption key and other parameters), then the next portion is encrypted, then the encryption state is transformed again and the next portion is then encrypted and so on, until all the input data is processed. The decryption works in a very similar way.\nThis is what developers should know about the \"block cipher modes of operation\" in order to use them correctly:\n\nCommonly used secure block modes are CBC (Cipher Block Chaining), CTR (Counter) and GCM (Galois/Counter Mode), which require a random (unpredictable) initialization vector (IV), known also as nonce or salt at the start.\nThe \"Counter (CTR)\" block mode is a good choice in the most cases because of strong security, arbitrary input data length (without padding) and parallel processing capabilities. It does not provide authentication and integrity, just encryption.\nThe GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) block mode takes all the advantages of the CTR mode and adds message authentication (produces a cryptographical message authentication tag). GCM is fast and efficient way to implement authenticated encryption in symmetric ciphers and it is highly recommended in the general case.\nThe CBC mode works in block of fixed size. Thus a padding algorithm should be used to make the last block the same length after splitting the input data into blocks. Most applications use the PKCS7 padding scheme#PKCS#5_and_PKCS#7) or ANSI X.923#ANSI_X.923). In some scenarios the CBC block mode might be vulnerable to the \"padding oracle\" attack, so its is better to avoid the CBC mode.\nWell-known insecure block mode is ECB (Electronic Codebook), which encrypts equal input blocks as equal output blocks (does not provide cryptographic diffusion). Don't use it! It may compromise the entire encryption.\nMost block like CBC, CTR and GCM modes supports \"random access\" decryption (e.g. seeking at arbitrary time offset in a video player, playing an encrypted video stream).\n\nCTR (Counter) Block Mode\nThe diagram below illustrates how portions (blocks) of the plaintext are encrypted one after another in the CTR block mode of operation using a block cipher:\n\nFor each block in CTR mode a new unpredictable keystream block is generated based on the initial vector (IV, sometimes called \"nonce\") + the current counter (01, 02, 03, ...) + the secret encryption key and the input block is merged by XOR with the current keystream block to produce the output block. In the CTR mode the final portion of the input data can be shorter then the cipher block size, so padding is not needed. The input data (before encryption) and the output data (after encryption) have the same length.\nGCM (Galois/Counter) Block Mode\nThe following diagram explains visually how the GCM block mode (Galois/Counter Mode) works:\nThe GCM mode uses a counter, which is increased for each block and calculated a message authentication tag (MAC code) after each processed block. The final authentication tag is calculated from the last block. Like all counter modes, GCM works as a stream cipher, and so it is essential that a different IV is used at the start for each stream that is encrypted.\nChoosing a Cipher Block Mode\nIt is recommended to use either CTR (Counter) or GCM (Galois/Counter) block modes with symmetric ciphers like AES, RC6, Camellia, Serpent and many others. The others might be helpful in certain situations, but some of them are less secure, so use them only if you know well what are you doing.\nThe CTR and GCM encryption modes have many advantages: they are secure (no significant flaws are currently known), can encrypt data of arbitrary length without padding, can encrypt and decrypt the blocks in parallel (in multi-core CPUs) and provide random (unordered) access to the encrypted blocks, so they are suitable for encrypting crypto-wallets, documents and streaming video (where users can seek by time). GCM provides also message authentication and is the recommended choice for cipher block mode in the general case.\nNote that the GCM, CTR and other block modes reveal the length of the original message. The length of the plaintext message is the same as the ciphertext length. If you want to avoid revealing the original plaintext length, you can add some random bytes to the plaintext before the encryption and remove them after decryption (this will be some kind of padding).\nThe Initialization Vector (IV)\nUse a random and unpredictable IV (nonce) for each encrypted message. It is a common mistake to encrypt multiple messages with the same symmetric key and using the same IV. This opens a space for various crypto attacks for the most block modes. The size of the IV should be the same as the cipher block size, e.g. 128-bits for AES, Serpent and Camellia.\nFor the GCM mode the IV may not be secret and unpredictable, but should be different for each message.\nAuthenticated Encryption\nIn cryptography the concept of \"authenticated encryption\" (AE) refers to a scheme to encrypt data and simultaneously calculate an authentication code (authentication tag / MAC), used to provide message authenticity and integrity. If authenticated encryption scheme is used, at the moment of decryption it will be known if the decryption is successful (i.e. whether the decryption key / password was correct and whether the encrypted data was not tampered).\nAuthenticated encryption (AE) is related to the similar concept authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD), which is a more secure variant of AE. AEAD binds associated data (AD) to the ciphertext and to the context where it's supposed to appear, so that attempts to \"cut-and-paste\" a valid ciphertext into a different context can be detected and rejected. AEAD is used in scenarios where encrypted and unencrypted data is used together (e.g. in encrypted networking protocols) and ensures that the entire data stream is authenticated and integrity protected. In other words, AEAD adds\\\nthe ability to check the integrity and authenticity of some\\\nAssociated Data (AD), also called \"Additional Authenticated Data\"\\\n(AAD), that is not encrypted.\nSome encryption schemes (like ChaCha20-Poly1305 and AES-GCM) provide integrated authenticated encryption (AEAD), while others (like AES-CBC and AES-CTR) need authentication to be added additionally (if you need it).\n"},"symmetric-key-ciphers/popular-symmetric-algorithms.html":{"url":"symmetric-key-ciphers/popular-symmetric-algorithms.html","title":"Popular Symmetric Algorithms","keywords":"","body":"Popular Symmetric Algorithms\nSymmetric key encryption algorithms (like AES) are designed by mathematicians and cryptographers with the idea, that it should be infeasible to decrypt the ciphertext without having the encryption key. This is true for the modern secure symmetric encryption algorithms (like AES and ChaCha20) and may be disputable or false for others, which are considered insecure symmetric encryption algorithms (like DES and RC4).\nSome popular symmetric encryption algorithms are: AES, ChaCha20, CAST, Twofish, IDEA, Serpent, RC5, RC6, Camellia and ARIA. All these algorithms are considered secure (when configured and used correctly).\nAES (Rijndael)\nAES (Advanced Encryption Standard, also known as Rijndael) is the most popular and widely used symmetric encryption algorithm in the modern IT industry. This is because AES is proven to be highly secure, fast and well standardised and very well supported on virtually all platforms. AES is 128-bit block cipher and uses 128, 192 or 256-bit secret keys. It is usually used in a block mode like AES-CTR or AES-GCM to process streaming data. In the most block modes AES require also a random 128-bit initial vector (IV, nonce).\nRijndael was the winner in the AES competition organized by NIST (1997-2000) and it was announced officially under the name \"AES\" (the next official symmetric block cipher after DES). In 2001 AES was adopted as official recommendation by the US government and no significant weakness or attack was found since this moment.\nThe Rijndael (AES) algorithm is free for any use: public or private, commercial or non-commercial.\nSalsa20 / ChaCha20\nSalsa20, along with its improved variants ChaCha (ChaCha8, ChaCha12, ChaCha20) and XSalsa20, are a family of modern, fast, symmetric stream ciphers, designed by the distinguished cryptographer Daniel Bernstein. The Salsa20 cipher was one of the finalists in the eSTREAM contest for designing of new symmetric stream ciphers (2004-2008) and was widely adopted afterwards, together with the related BLAKE hash function. Salsa20 and its variants are royalty-free, not patented.\nThe Salsa20 cipher takes as input a 128-bit or 256-bit symmetric secret key + randomly generated 64-bit nonce (initial vector) and a stream of data of unlimited length and produces as output an encrypted stream of data with the same length as the input stream. The Salsa20 cipher is typically used as authenticated encryption construction: ChaCha20-Poly1305.\nOther Popular Symmetric Ciphers\nOther modern secure symmetric ciphers, used more rarely than EAS and ChaCha20, but still popular in the software developer and information security communities, are the following:\n\nSerpent) - secure symmetric-key block cipher (key size: 128, 192 or 256 bits), public domain, not patented\nTwofish - secure symmetric-key block cipher (key sizes: 128, 192 or 256 bits), royalty-free, not patented\nCamellia) - secure symmetric key block cipher (block size: 128 bits; key sizes: 128, 192 and 256 bits), patented, but free for non-commercial use\nRC5 - secure symmetric-key block cipher (key size: 128 to 2040 bits; block size: 32, 64 or 128 bits; rounds: 1 ... 255), insecure with short keys (56-bit key successfully brute-forced), was patented until 2015, now royalty-free\nRC6 - secure symmetric-key block cipher, similar to RC5, but more complicated (key size: 128 to 2040 bits; block size: 32, 64 or 128 bits; rounds: 1 ... 255), was patented until 2017, now royalty-free\nIDEA - secure symmetric-key block cipher (key size: 128 bits), was patented until 2012, now royalty-free\nCAST (CAST-128 / CAST5, CAST-256 / CAST6) - family of secure symmetric-key block ciphers (key sizes: 40 ... 256 bits), royalty-free basis for commercial and non-commercial use\nARIA) - secure symmetric-key block cipher, similar to AES (key size: 128, 192 or 256 bits), official standard in South Korea, free for public use\nSM4) - secure symmetric-key block cipher, similar to AES (key size: 128 bits), official standard in China, free for public use\n\nInsecure Symmetric Algorithms\nSome other symmetric encryption algorithms were popular in the past, but are now considered insecure (broken algorithms) or having disputable security and are not recommended to be used any more:\n\nDES - 56-bit key size, practically broken, can be brute-forced\n3DES (Triple DES) - 64-bit cipher, considered broken\nRC2 - 64-bit cipher, considered broken\nRC4 - stream cipher, broken, practical attacks demonstrated\nBlowfish) - old 64-bit cipher, broken, practical attacks demonstrated\nGOST) - Russian 64-bit block cipher, disputable security, considered risky\n\nSymmetric Encryption Schemes / Constructions\nIn addition to the above mentioned symmetric key ciphers, cryptographers have proposed many symmetric encryption schemes (constructions), like the most popular authenticated encryption (AEAD) schemes:\n\nChaCha20-Poly1305\nThe ChaCha20 stream cipher with integrated Poly1305 authenticator (integrated authenticated AEAD encryption)\nRequires a 256-bit key and random 96-bit nonce\nExtremely high performance\nImplemented by the most modern crypto-libraries\n\n\nAES-256-GCM\nAES-GCM is the AES (Rijndael) block cipher in GCM block mode (integrated authenticated AEAD encryption), behaves like a stream cipher\nRequired 256-bit key and random 128-bit nonce (initial vector)\nImplemented by the most modern crypto libraries\n\n\n\nMost applications today should prefer some of the above encryption schemes for symmetric encryption, instead of constructing their own encryption scheme.

AES operates using block size of 128 bits and symmetric keys of length 128, 160, 192, 224 and 256 bits.\nAES is Secure and Very Popular Symmetric Encryption Algorithm\nThe AES symmetric encryption algorithm is considered highly secure (when configured correctly) and no significant practical attacks are known for AES in its history.\nAES is used internally by the most Internet Web sites today for serving https:// content as part of the TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) standards for secure host to host communication on the Web.\nDue to its wide use in the Internet secure communication, modern CPU hardware implements AES instructions at the microprocessor level to speed-up the AES encryption and decryption.\nAES Algorithm Parameters\nThe AES algorithm can operate with different key lengths, but the block size is always 128 bits. For most application 128-bit AES encryption (AES-128) is enough, but for higher encryption level, it is recommended to use AES-256 (256-bit key length).\nLike any other block ciphers, AES can use one of several modes of operation (CBC, ECB, CTR, …) to allow encryption of data of arbitrary length. The recommended mode for the general case and for encrypting blockchain wallets is \"CTR\".\nMost modes of operation require an initial vector (IV). When using a counter mode (CTR), i.e. AES-128-CTR (128-bit) or AES-256-CTR (256-bit) for example, first a non-secret random salt (IV) should be generated and saved along with the encrypted ciphertext output. The size of the IV is always the same as the size of the block, i.e. 128 bits (16 bytes).\nThe AES encryption, combined with CTR block mode and random IV causes the encryption algorithm to produce different encrypted ciphertext each time, when the same input data is encrypted. This ensures that nobody can construct a dictionary to reverse back the encrypted ciphertext.\nAES encryption in CBC mode uses a padding algorithm (like PKCS7 or ANSI X.923) to help splitting the input data into blocks of fixed block-size (e.g. 128 bits) before passing the blocks to the AES-CBC algorithm. Most developers use the CTR mode of operation for AES, so they don't need padding.\nWithout using a block mode, the ciphertext, generated by the AES algorithm is exactly 128 bits (16 bytes), just like the block size. The input data is also exactly 128 bits.\nThe ciphertext, generated by the AES-CTR algorithm (AES in CTR cipher block mode) has the same size like the size of the input data. No padding is required.\nThe ciphertext, generated by the AES-CBC algorithm (AES in CBC ciphertext mode), has size of 128 bits (16 bytes) or multiple of 128 bits. The input data should be padded before encryption and unpadded after decryption.\nThe AES algorithm often is used along with a password-to-key derivation function, e.g. Scrypt(passwd) -> key or PBKDF2(passwd) -> key.\nIntegrated Message Authentication Code (MAC)\nThe AES algorithm may use MAC (message authentication code) to check the password validity, e.g. HMAC(text, key).\nThe MAC code is typically integrated (see the concept of integrated encryption) in the algorithm's output. It is calculated from the input message, together with the encryption key. From the calculated MAC, it is impossible to reveal the input message or the key, so the MAC itself is not a secret. Some block cipher modes (like AES-GCM) integrate message authentication in the obtained ciphertext as part of their work, so you don't need to add MAC explicitly.\nTypically MAC is calculated and used like this:\n\nBefore the encryption, the MAC is calculated as: mac = HMAC-SHA256(input_msg, key).\nThe input data is encrypted and the ciphertext is stored along with the random salt (IV) and the MAC.\nAfter decryption, the MAC is calculated again and is compared with the MAC stored along with the encrypted message.\nIf the MAC is the same, the decryption is successful: correct ciphertext + decryption key + algorithms settings (IV, block mode, padding algorithm).\nIf the MAC is different, the decryption is not successful: incorrect key / password or broken ciphertext, incorrect MAC or different algorithms settings (IV, block mode, padding, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe MAC can be calculated and verified using several approaches to integrated encryption: Encrypt-then-MAC, Encrypt-and-MAC, MAC-then-Encrypt.\nThe AES Encryption Process\nThe entire AES encryption process (password-based authenticated encryption) looks like this:\n\nAlgorithm parameters are selected (e.g. AES, 128-bit, CTR mode + Scrypt + Scrypt parameters + MAC algorithm). These parameters can be hard-coded in the AES algorithm implementation source code or can be specified as input for the AES encrypt and decrypt. Always use the same parameters for encryption and decryption.\nThe encryption key is derived from the encryption password using a key-derivation function (KDF), e.g. Scrypt (with certain parameters):\n\n\nThe AES encryption scheme takes as input the input msg + the encryption key. It produces as output the ciphertext + the randomly generated IV (128-bit salt) + the MAC code:\n\n\nIn case of authenticated encryption (e.g. AES-GCM), the MAC is already calculated automatically during the AES encryption process.\nIf the encryption scheme is not authenticated encryption (e.g. AER-CTR), the MAC code is not calculated automatically by the AES encryption process and should be calculated additionally. The MAC code can be calculated from the input msg, using the encryption key (or some transformation of it) and some MAC function (like HMAC-SHA-256):\n\n\nThe ciphertext is calculated through the AES encryption algorithm. It first generates a random salt (IV) and uses it to transform the input msg using the encryption key, through the AES cipher encryption logic:\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the encrypted output is generated. It holds the ciphertext + IV + MAC. Optionally, it holds also the algorithm settings.\n\nThe AES Decryption Process\nThe opposite AES decryption process (password-based authenticated decryption) looks like this:\n\nInitialize the same AES algorithm parameters for the decryption process, exactly like the ones used during the encryption.\nUse the decryption key and the IV from the encrypted message to decrypt the ciphertext using the AES algorithm decryption logic. The output is the original message (the input msg, which was previously passed through AES encryption):\n\n\nIn case of authenticated encryption (like AES-GCM), the integrated MAC code is verified during the decryption process.\nIn case of unauthenticated encryption (like AES-CTR), the MAC code should be calculated and verified additionally, as it is described in the next few step.\n\n\nCalculate HMAC of the original message (obtained during the decryption):\n\n\nCompare the encryption MAC (the MAC of the input message, before the encryption) with the decryption MAC (the MAC of the original message, recovered by the decryption):\n\n\nIf the MAC codes are the same, the decryption was correct and the original message is obtained.\nIf the MAC codes are different, the decryption was failed and the original message is not the obtained one. This may happen due to many reasons, most likely \"wrong password\". Other reasons: incorrect ciphertext, incorrect IV, incorrect algorithm settings, incorrect KDF function or KDF parameters, etc.\n\n\n\nNow it is time to illustrate the above described concepts through working source code to AES encrypt / decrypt an input msg by given password.\n"},"symmetric-key-ciphers/aes-encrypt-decrypt-examples.html":{"url":"symmetric-key-ciphers/aes-encrypt-decrypt-examples.html","title":"AES Encrypt / Decrypt - Examples","keywords":"","body":"AES Encrypt / Decrypt - Examples\nLet's illustrate the AES encryption and AES decryption concepts through working source code in Python.\nThe first example below will illustrate a simple password-based AES encryption (PBKDF2 + AES-CTR) without message authentication (unauthenticated encryption). The next example will add message authentication (using the AES-GCM mode), then will add password to key derivation (AES-256-GCM + Scrypt).\nSimple AES-CTR Example\nLet's start with simple AES-256-CTR non-authenticated encryption.\nInstall Python Libraries pyaes and pbkdf2\nFirst, install the Python library pyaes that implements the AES symmetric key encryption algorithm:\npip install pyaes\n\nNext, install the Python library pbkdf2 that implements the PBKDF2 password-to-key derivation algorithm:\npip install pbkdf2\n\nNow, let's play with a simple AES encrypt / decrypt example.\nPassword to Key Derivation\nFirst start by key derivation: from password to 256-bit encryption key.\nimport pyaes, pbkdf2, binascii, os, secrets\n\n# Derive a 256-bit AES encryption key from the password\npassword = \"s3cr3t*c0d3\"\npasswordSalt = os.urandom(16)\nkey = pbkdf2.PBKDF2(password, passwordSalt).read(32)\nprint('AES encryption key:', binascii.hexlify(key))\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/AES-CTR-in-Python.\nThe above code derives a 256-bit key using the PBKDF2 key derivation algorithm from the password s3cr3t*c0d3. It uses a random password derivation salt (128-bit). This salt should be stored in the output, together with the ciphertext, because without it the decryption key cannot be derived again and the decryption will be impossible.\nThe output from the above code may look like this:\nAES encryption key: b'7625e224dc0f0ec91ad28c1ee67b1eb96d1a5459533c5c950f44aae1e32f2da3'\nThe derived key consists of 64 hex digits (32 bytes), which represents a 256-bit integer number. It will be different if you run the above code several times, because a random salt is used every time. If you use the same salt, the same key will be derived.\nAES Encryption (CTR Block Mode)\nNext, generate a random 256-bit initial vector (IV) for the AES CTR block mode and perform the AES-256-CTR encryption:\n# Encrypt the plaintext with the given key:\n#   ciphertext = AES-256-CTR-Encrypt(plaintext, key, iv)\niv = secrets.randbits(256)\nplaintext = \"Text for encryption\"\naes = pyaes.AESModeOfOperationCTR(key, pyaes.Counter(iv))\nciphertext = aes.encrypt(plaintext)\nprint('Encrypted:', binascii.hexlify(ciphertext))\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/AES-encryption-in-Python.\nThe output from the above code may look like this:\nEncrypted: b'53022cf12c5959ddf3e733128930dd3d52e3ea'\nThe ciphertext consists of 38 hex digits (19 bytes, 152 bits). This is the size of the input data, the message Text for encryption.\nNote that after AES-CTR encryption the initial vector (IV) should be stored along with the ciphertext, because without it, the decryption will be impossible. The IV should be randomly generated for each AES encryption (not hard-coded) for higher security.\nNote also that if you encrypt the same plaintext with the same encryption key several times, the output will be different every time, due to the randomness in the IV. This is intended behavior and it increases the security, e.g. resistance to dictionary attacks.\nAES Decryption (CTR Block Mode)\nNow let's see how to decrypt a ciphertext using the AES-CTR-256 algorithm. The input consists of ciphertext + encryption key + the IV for the CTR counter. The output is the original plaintext. The code is pretty simple:\n# Decrypt the ciphertext with the given key:\n#   plaintext = AES-256-CTR-Decrypt(ciphertext, key, iv)\naes = pyaes.AESModeOfOperationCTR(key, pyaes.Counter(iv))\ndecrypted = aes.decrypt(ciphertext)\nprint('Decrypted:', decrypted)\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/AES-decryption-in-Python.\nThe output of the above should be like this:\nDecrypted: b'Text for encryption'\nNote that the aes object should be initialized again, because the CTR cipher block mode algorithm keeps an internal state that changes over the time.\nNote also that the above code cannot detect wrong key, wrong ciphertext or wrong IV. If you use an incorrect key to decrypt the ciphertext, you will get a wrong unreadable text. This is clearly visible by the code below:\nkey = os.urandom(32)   # random decryption key\naes = pyaes.AESModeOfOperationCTR(key, pyaes.Counter(iv))\nprint('Wrongly decrypted:', aes.decrypt(ciphertext))\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/AES-decryption-wrong-key-in-Python.\nThe output of the above incorrect decryption attempt might be like this:\nWrongly decrypted: b'\\xe6!\\n\\x9a\\xa9\\x15\\x12\\xd9\\xcb\\x9cS\\x86\\xcc\\xe1\\x1d\\x1a\\x8blw'\nNow it is your time to play with the above code example. Try to to encrypt and decrypt different messages, to change the input message, the key size, to hard-code the IV, the key and other parameters, switch to CBC mode, and see how the results change. Enjoy learning by playing.\nAES-256-GCM Example\nNow, let's give a full example how to use the AES-256-GCM symmetric encryption construction. We shall use a different Python library for AES, called pycryptodome, which supports the the AES-256-GCM construction:\npip install pycryptodome\n\nNext, let's play with the below AES-GCM example in Python, which generates a random encryption key (secret key) and uses it to encrypt a text message, then decrypts it back to the original plaintext message:\nfrom Crypto.Cipher import AES\nimport binascii, os\n\ndef encrypt_AES_GCM(msg, secretKey):\n    aesCipher = AES.new(secretKey, AES.MODE_GCM)\n    ciphertext, authTag = aesCipher.encrypt_and_digest(msg)\n    return (ciphertext, aesCipher.nonce, authTag)\n\ndef decrypt_AES_GCM(encryptedMsg, secretKey):\n    (ciphertext, nonce, authTag) = encryptedMsg\n    aesCipher = AES.new(secretKey, AES.MODE_GCM, nonce)\n    plaintext = aesCipher.decrypt_and_verify(ciphertext, authTag)\n    return plaintext\n\nsecretKey = os.urandom(32)  # 256-bit random encryption key\nprint(\"Encryption key:\", binascii.hexlify(secretKey))\n\nmsg = b'Message for AES-256-GCM + Scrypt encryption'\nencryptedMsg = encrypt_AES_GCM(msg, secretKey)\nprint(\"encryptedMsg\", {\n    'ciphertext': binascii.hexlify(encryptedMsg[0]),\n    'aesIV': binascii.hexlify(encryptedMsg[1]),\n    'authTag': binascii.hexlify(encryptedMsg[2])\n})\n\ndecryptedMsg = decrypt_AES_GCM(encryptedMsg, secretKey)\nprint(\"decryptedMsg\", decryptedMsg)\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/AES-256-GCM-in-Python.\nThe AES-GCM encryption takes as input a message + encryption key and produces as output a set of values: { ciphertext + nonce + authTag }.\n\nThe ciphertext is the encrypted message.\nThe nonce is the randomly generated initial vector (IV) for the GCM construction.\nThe authTag is the message authentication code (MAC) calculated during the encryption.\n\nThe encryption key size generated in the above code is 256 bits (32 bytes) and it configures the AES-GCM cipher as AES-256-GCM. If we change the key size to 128 bits or 192 bits, we shall use AES-128-GCM or AES-192-GCM respectively.\nThe output from the above code looks like this:\nEncryption key: b'233f8ce4ac6aa125927ccd98af5750d08c9c61d98a3f5d43cbf096b4caaebe80'\nencryptedMsg {'ciphertext': b'1334cd5d487f7f47924187c94424a2079656838e063e5521e7779e441aa513de268550a89917fbfb0492fc', 'aesIV': b'2f3849399c60cb04b923bd33265b81c7', 'authTag': b'af453a410d142bc6f926c0f3bc776390'}\ndecryptedMsg b'Message for AES-256-GCM + Scrypt encryption'\nIt is visible that the encryption key above is 256 bits (64 hex digits), the ciphertext has the same length as the input message (43 bytes), the IV is 128 bits (32 hex digits) and the authentication tag is 128 bits (32 hex digits). If we change something before the decryption (e.g. the ciphertext of the IV), we will get and exception, because the message integrity will be broken:\nencryptedMsg = (b'wrong chiphertext', encryptedMsg[1], encryptedMsg[2])\ndecryptedMsg = decrypt_AES_GCM(encryptedMsg, secretKey)  # ValueError: MAC check failed\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/AES-256-GCM-wrong-chiphertext-in-Python.\nAES-256-GCM + Scrypt Example\nNow let's give a more complex example: AES encryption of text by text password. We shall use the authenticated encryption construction AES-256-GCM, combined with Scrypt key derivation:\nfrom Crypto.Cipher import AES\nimport scrypt, os, binascii\n\ndef encrypt_AES_GCM(msg, password):\n    kdfSalt = os.urandom(16)\n    secretKey = scrypt.hash(password, kdfSalt, N=16384, r=8, p=1, buflen=32)\n    aesCipher = AES.new(secretKey, AES.MODE_GCM)\n    ciphertext, authTag = aesCipher.encrypt_and_digest(msg)\n    return (kdfSalt, ciphertext, aesCipher.nonce, authTag)\n\ndef decrypt_AES_GCM(encryptedMsg, password):\n    (kdfSalt, ciphertext, nonce, authTag) = encryptedMsg\n    secretKey = scrypt.hash(password, kdfSalt, N=16384, r=8, p=1, buflen=32)\n    aesCipher = AES.new(secretKey, AES.MODE_GCM, nonce)\n    plaintext = aesCipher.decrypt_and_verify(ciphertext, authTag)\n    return plaintext\n\nmsg = b'Message for AES-256-GCM + Scrypt encryption'\npassword = b's3kr3tp4ssw0rd'\nencryptedMsg = encrypt_AES_GCM(msg, password)\nprint(\"encryptedMsg\", {\n    'kdfSalt': binascii.hexlify(encryptedMsg[0]),\n    'ciphertext': binascii.hexlify(encryptedMsg[1]),\n    'aesIV': binascii.hexlify(encryptedMsg[2]),\n    'authTag': binascii.hexlify(encryptedMsg[3])\n})\n\ndecryptedMsg = decrypt_AES_GCM(encryptedMsg, password)\nprint(\"decryptedMsg\", decryptedMsg)\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/AES-256-GCM-with-Scrypt-in-Python.\nThe above code encrypts using AES-256-GCM given text message by given text password.\n\nDuring the encryption, the Scrypt KDF function is used (with some fixed parameters) to derive a secret key from the password. The randomly generated KDF salt for the key derivation is stored together with the encrypted message and will be used during the decryption. Then the input message is AES-encrypted using the secret key and the output consists of ciphertext + IV (random nonce) + authTag. The final output holds these 3 values + the KDF salt.\nDuring the decryption, the Scrypt key derivation (with the same parameters) is used to derive the same secret key from the encryption password, together with the KDF salt (which was generated randomly during the encryption). Then the ciphertext is AES-decrypted using the secret key, the IV (nonce) and the authTag. In case of success, the result is the decrypted original plaintext. In case of error, the authentication tag will fail to authenticate the decryption process and an exception will be thrown.\n\nThe output from the above code looks like this:\nencryptedMsg {'kdfSalt': b'2dd0b783290747ba62a63fc53591170d', 'ciphertext': b'223ed888dcd216dcd40c47ff7cdaa7fd7eab65f4f0405350a43c5cad5b6b47b527c709edec29d7d6967518', 'aesIV': b'7f114d946c77508ed2e6afe652c78f21', 'authTag': b'e84a14b9542320a0b1473141c989c48f'}\ndecryptedMsg b'Message for AES-256-GCM + Scrypt encryption'\nIf you run the same code, the output will be different, due to randomness (random KDF salt + random AES nonce).\n"},"symmetric-key-ciphers/ethereum-wallet-encryption.html":{"url":"symmetric-key-ciphers/ethereum-wallet-encryption.html","title":"Ethereum Wallet Encryption","keywords":"","body":"Ethereum Wallet Encryption\nTo illustrate the application of the AES cipher in action, we shall look into one real-world example: the standard encrypted wallet file format for the Ethereum blockchain. We shall see how AES-128-CTR cipher is combined with Scrypt and MAC to securely implement authenticated symmetric key encryption by text-based password.\nEthereum UTC / JSON Wallets\nIn public blockchain networks (like Bitcoin and Ethereum) the private keys of the blockchain asset holders are stored in special keystores, called crypto wallets. Typically these crypto-wallets are files on the local hard disk, encrypted by a password.\nIn the Ethereum blockchain crypto wallets are internally stored in a special encrypted format known as \"UTC / JSON Wallet (Keystore File)\" or \"Web3 Secret Storage Definition\". This is the wallet file format, used in geth and Parity (the leading protocol implementations for Ethereum), in MyEtherWallet (popular online client-side Ethereum wallet), in MetaMask (widely used in-browser Ethereum wallet), in the ethers.js and Nethereum libraries and in many other Ethereum-related technologies and tools.\nThe Ethereum UTC / JSON keystores keep the encrypted private key (or wallet seed words) as JSON text document, specifying the encrypted data, encryption algorithms and their parameters.\nUTC / JSON Keystore - Example\nLet's look into a sample UTC / JSON keystore file, which holds a password-protected 256-bit private key.\n{\n  \"version\": 3,\n  \"id\": \"07a9f767-93c5-4842-9afd-b3b083659f04\",\n  \"address\": \"aef8cad64d29fcc4ed07629b9e896ebc3160a8d0\",\n  \"Crypto\": {\n    \"ciphertext\": \"99d0e66c67941a08690e48222a58843ef2481e110969325db7ff5284cd3d3093\",\n    \"cipherparams\": { \"iv\": \"7d7fabf8dee2e77f0d7e3ff3b965fc23\" },\n    \"cipher\": \"aes-128-ctr\",\n    \"kdf\": \"scrypt\",\n    \"kdfparams\": {\n      \"dklen\": 32,\n      \"salt\": \"85ad073989d461c72358ccaea3551f7ecb8e672503cb05c2ee80cfb6b922f4d4\",\n      \"n\": 8192,\n      \"r\": 8,\n      \"p\": 1\n      },\n    \"mac\": \"06dcf1cc4bffe1616fafe94a2a7087fd79df444756bb17c93af588c3ab02a913\"\n  }\n}\n\nThe above JSON document is a classical example of authenticated symmetric encryption.\nWhat Is Inside the UTC / JSON File?\nTypically a UTC / JSON keystore holds the following data:\n\nKey-derivation function (KDF) used to transform the text-based wallet encryption password into an AES symmetric key, used to encrypt the wallet contents. Usually the KDF function is \"scrypt\".\nThe KDF parameters - the parameters used in the KDF function to derive the password (e.g. iterations count, salt, etc.)\n\n\nThe ciphertext - the encrypted wallet content (typically holds an encrypted 256-bit private key).\nSymmetric cipher algorithm + its parameters, e.g. AES-128-CTR + initial vector (IV).\nMAC - message authentication code used (MAC) to check the message integrity after it is decrypted (to know whether the wallet decryption password was correct or not).\nEthereum calculates the MAC by calculating keccak-256 hash of the concatenations of the second-leftmost 16 bytes of the derived key together with the full ciphertext.\n\n\nAdditional metadata: wallet format version, wallet unique id (uuid) and the blockchain address, controlled by this wallet.\n\nBy default the key-derivation function is scrypt and uses weak scrypt parameters (n=8192 cost factor, r=8 block size, p=1 parallelization), so it is recommended to use long and complex passwords to avoid brute-force wallet decryption attacks.\nMyEtherWallet: Play with UTC / JSON Keystore Files\nTo learn better the file format behind the Ethereum UTC / JSON keystore files, play with MyEtherWallet.\n\nFollow the steps below to create a new random Ethereum crypto wallet and view its encrypted JSON content:\n\nOpen the MyEtherWallet web site: https://myetherwallet.com.\nChoose a password and create a new wallet.\nDownload the Keystore File (UTC / JSON).\nSee what's inside the downloaded file.\nTry to make some changes, try to decrypt it with wrong password and other changes.\nEnjoy learning by playing.\n\n"},"symmetric-key-ciphers/exercises-aes-encrypt-decrypt.html":{"url":"symmetric-key-ciphers/exercises-aes-encrypt-decrypt.html","title":"Exercises: AES Encrypt / Decrypt","keywords":"","body":"Exercises: AES Encrypt / Decrypt\nIn this exercise we shall encrypt and decrypt a text message using a symmetric cipher AES-CBC-256, combined with Scrypt password-to-key derivation and HMAC message authentication code.

Different public key cryptosystems may provide one or more of the following capabilities:\n\nKey-pair generation: generate random pairs of private key + corresponding public key.\nEncryption / decryption: encrypt date by public key and decrypt data by private key (often using a hybrid encryption scheme).\nDigital signatures (message authentication): sign messages by private key and verify signatures by public key.\nKey-exchange algorithms: securely exchange cryptographic key between two parties over insecure channel.\n\nThe most important and most used public-key cryptosystems are RSA and ECC. Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is the recommended and most preferable modern public-key cryptosystem, especially with the modern highly optimized and secure curves (like Curve25519 and Curve448), because of smaller keys, shorter signatures and better performance.\nThe RSA public-key cryptosystem) is based on the mathematical concept of modular exponentiation (numbers raised to a power by modulus), along with some mathematical constructions and the integer factorization problem (which is considered to be computationally infeasible for large enough keys).\nThe elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) cryptosystem is based on the math of the on the algebraic structure of the elliptic curves over finite fields and the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP), which is considered to be computationally infeasible for large keys. ECC comes together with the ECDSA algorithm (elliptic-curve digital signature algorithm). ECC uses smaller keys and signatures than RSA and is prefered in most modern apps. We shall discuss ECC and ECDSA later in details, along with examples.\nMost public-key cryptosystems (like RSA, ECC, DSA, ECDSA and EdDSA) are quantum-breakable (quantum-unsafe), which means that (at least on theory) a powerful enough quantum computer will be able to break their security and compute the private key from given public key in seconds.\nAsymmetric Encryption Schemes\nAsymmetric encryption is more complicated than symmetric encryption, not only because it uses public and private keys, but because asymmetric encryption can encrypt / decrypt only small messages, which should be mapped to the underlying math of the public-key cryptosystem. Some cryptosystems (like ECC) do not provide directly encryption primitives, so more complex schemes should be used.\nIn the RSA system, the input message should be transformed to big integer (e.g. using OAEP padding), while in ECC the message cannot be directly encrypted and more complex encryption scheme is used, based on the elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (ECDH). It will be explained in details later in this chapter. Additionally, asymmetric ciphers are significantly slower than symmetric ciphers (e.g. the RSA encryption is 1000 times slower than AES).\nTo overcome the above limitations and to allow encrypting messages of any size, modern cryptography uses asymmetric encryption schemes (also known as public key encryption schemes / asymmetric encryption constructions / hybrid encryption schemes), like key encapsulation mechanisms (KEM) and integrated encrypted schemes, which combine asymmetric encryption with symmetric key ciphers.\nThis is how a large document or file can be encrypted by combining public-key cryptography and symmetric crypto algorithm:\n.png>)\nIn the above diagram the encrypted symmetric key is known as KEM block (encapsulated key, with public key encryption) and the encrypted data file is known as DEM block (encapsulated data, with symmetric encryption). The encrypted message consists of these two blocks together (encapsulated key + encapsulated data).\nThis is the corresponding decryption process (decrypt an encrypted large document using public-key cryptography and symmetric crypto algorithm):\n\nExamples of such asymmetric encryption schemes are: RSA-OAEP, RSA-KEM and ECIES-KEM.\nIntegrated Encryption Schemes\nIntegrated encryption schemes (IES) are modern public key encryption schemes, which combine symmetric ciphers, asymmetric ciphers and key-derivation algorithms to provide secure public-key based encryption (PKE). In EIS scheme asymmetric algorithms (like RSA or ECC) are used to encrypt or encapsulate a symmetric key, used later by symmetric ciphers (like AES or ChaCha20) to encrypt the input message. Some EIS schemes provide also message authentication. Examples of EIS schemes are DLIES (Discrete Logarithm Integrated Encryption Scheme) and ECIES (Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme).\nKey Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs)\nA key encapsulation mechanisms (KEM) are asymmetric cryptographic techniques used to encrypt and encapsulate a secret key (called \"ephemeral symmetric key\"), which is used to encrypt an input message using a symmetric cryptographic cipher. KEM encapsulates the ephemeral symmetric encryption key as part of the encrypted message, by encrypting it with the recipient's public key. In cryptography this process is known as \"key encapsulation\".\nThe output from a KEM-based hybrid encryption scheme consists of KEM block, holding the encapsulated encrypted symmetric key (or certain parameters used to derive it), and DEM block (data encapsulation mechanism), holding the encapsulated symmetrically-encrypted data (cipher parameters + ciphertext + optionally an authentication tag).\nKey encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) are used in the hybrid encryption schemes and in the integrated encryption schemes, where a random element is generated in the underlying public-key cryptosystem and a symmetric key is derived from this random element by hashing. This approach simplifies the process of combining asymmetric and symmetric encryption. Examples of modern key encapsulation mechanisms are: RSA-KEM, ECIES-KEM and PSEC-KEM.\nKey encapsulation should not be confused with key wrapping.\n\nKey encapsulation (KEM) refers to public-key encryption of another key (symmetric or asymmetric). It is used for creating provably secure hybrid encryption schemes, e.g. to encrypt an AES secret key by given ECC public key.\nKey wrapping refers to symmetric-key encryption of another key (which can be either a symmetric key or an asymmetric key). It is used to encrypt, integrity-protect and transport cryptographic keys. Key wrapping provides privacy and integrity protection for specialized data such as cryptographic keys, without the use of nonces. For details see RFC 3394.\n\nDigital Signatures\nIn cryptography digital signatures provide message authentication, integrity and non-repudiation for digital documents. Digital signatures work in the public-key cryptosystems and use a public / private key pairs. Message signing is performed by the private key and message verification is performed by the corresponding public key.\nA message signature mathematically guarantees that certain message was signed by certain (secret) private key, which corresponds to certain (non-secret) public key. After a message is signed, the message and the signature cannot be modified and thus message authentication and integrity is provided. Anyone, who knows the public key of the message signer, can verify the signature. Аfter signing the signature author cannot reject the act of signing (this is known as non-repudiation).\nDigital signatures are widely used today for signing digital contracts, for authorizing bank payments and signing transactions in the public blockchain systems for transferring digital assets.\nMost public-key cryptosystems like RSA and ECC provide secure digital signature schemes like DSA, ECDSA and EdDSA. We shall discuss the digital signatures in greater detail later in this section.\nKey Exchange Algorithms\nIn cryptography key exchange algorithms (key agreement protocols / key negotiation schemes) allow cryptographic keys to be exchanged between two parties, allowing the use of a cryptographic algorithm, in most cases symmetric encryption cipher. For example, when a laptop connects to the home WiFi router, both parties agree on a session key, used to symmetrically encrypt the network traffic between them.\nMost key-exchange algorithms are based on public-key cryptography and the math behind this system: discrete logarithms, elliptic curves or other.\nAnonymous key exchange, like Diffie–Hellman (DHKE and ECDH), does not provide authentication of the parties, and is thus vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, but is safe from traffic interception (sniffing) attacks.\nAuthenticated key agreement schemes authenticate the identities of parties involved in the key exchange and thus prevent man-in-the-middle attacks by use of digitally signed keys (e.g. PKI certificate), password-authenticated key agreement or other method.\n"},"asymmetric-key-ciphers/the-rsa-cryptosystem-concepts.html":{"url":"asymmetric-key-ciphers/the-rsa-cryptosystem-concepts.html","title":"The RSA Cryptosystem - Concepts","keywords":"","body":"The RSA Cryptosystem - Concepts\nThe RSA cryptosystem) is one of the first public-key cryptosystems, based on the math of the modular exponentiations and the computational difficulty of the RSA problem and the closely related integer factorization problem (IFP). The RSA algorithm is named after the initial letters of its authors (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) and is widely used in the early ages of computer cryptography.\nLater, when ECC cryptography evolved, the ECC slowly became dominant in the asymmetric cryptosystems, because of its higher security and shorter key lengths than RSA.\nThe RSA algorithm provides:\n\nKey-pair generation: generate random private key (typically of size 1024-4096 bits) and corresponding public key.\nEncryption: encrypt a secret message (integer in the range [0...key_length]) using the public key and decrypt it back using the secret key.\nDigital signatures: sign messages (using the private key) and verify message signature (using the public key).\nKey exchange: securely transport a secret key, used for encrypted communication later.\n\nRSA can work with keys of different keys of length: 1024, 2048, 3072, 4096, 8129, 16384 or even more bits. Key length of 3072-bits and above are considered secure. Longer keys provide higher security but consume more computing time, so there is a tradeoff between security and speed. Very long RSA keys (e.g. 50000 bits or 65536 bits) may be too slow for practical use, e.g. key generation may take from several minutes to several hours.\nRSA Key Generation\nGenerating an RSA public + private key pair involves the following:\nUsing some non-trivial math computations from the number theory#Key_generation), find three very large integers e, d and n, such that:\n\n(me)d ≡ m (mod n) for all m in the range [0...n)\n\nThe integer number n is called \"modulus\" and it defines the RSA key length. It is typically very large prime number (e.g. 2048 bits).\nThe pair {n, e} is the public key. It is designed to be shared with everyone. The number e is called \"public key exponent\". It is usually 65537 (0x010001).\nThe pair {n, d} is the private key. It is designed to be kept in secret. It is practically infeasible to calculate the private key from the public key {n, e}. The number d is called \"private key exponent\" (the secret exponent).\nRSA Public Key - Example\nExample of 2048-bit RSA public key (represented as 2048-bit hexadecimal integer modulus n and 24-bit public exponent e):\nn = 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\ne = 0x010001\nThe same RSA public key, encoded in the traditional for RSA format PKCS#8 PEM ASN.1 looks like this:\n-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEApwni+ErA4h6wyqAYz39p\nf3dOlvgRX8I1npz2Cx3Y1ASNl0zfhCK+9r48FisEuRb36iEz8OPk4O7hZIWb2cHg\n7wNXwUL09jO0rdSquGyPiJXNM/v04CTZo61r5iZ1cLSnLSw0NU4BOedK2mZaFqJh\nFJDeu44TGmz/x+8l50JAgD3XGk/NlTyYgRGwqpu8TFcCT8XoxEYq2QScfxq+2FnG\nNFX6bVi1zDSj0yBv90uelsM226zwzdGO0MZnls4AqwfzayTL4zQlI/2CFajnf4no\nagjbkR8jdFk4je5kLa58smRKA+ce1cb6UHfPQJD6+lVgSLU2uHmoj2KGmPDHtCDE\ntwIDAQAB\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\nThe above PEM ASN.1-encoded message, holding the RSA public key, can be decoded here: https://lapo.it/asn1js.\nRSA Private Key -

Text messages should be encoded as integers in the range [0...n) before encryption (see EAOP). For larger texts, hybrid encryption should be used (encrypt a secret key and use it to symmetrically encrypt the text, see RSA-KEM).\nThe above operation cannot be reversed: no efficient algorithm exists to calculate msg from encryptedMsg, e and n (see the RSA problem), which all are public (non-secret) by design.\nRSA Cryptography: Decrypt a Message\nDecrypting the encrypted message using the corresponding RSA private key {n, d} is done by the following transformation:\n\ndecryptedMsg = (encryptedMsg)d mod n\n\nWhy this is correct? Recall, that by definition the RSA key-pair has the following property:\n\n(me)d ≡ m (mod n) for any m in the range [0...n)\n\nFrom the encryption transformation we have:\n\nencryptedMsg = (msg)e mod n\n\nHence:\n\ndecryptedMsg = (encryptedMsg)d mod n = ((msg)e mod n)d = ((msg)e)d mod n = (msg) mod n = msg\n\nRSA Encrypt and Decrypt - Example\nLet examine one example of RSA encryption and decryption, along with the calculations, following the above formulas. Assume we have generated the RSA public-private key pair:\n\nmodulus n = 143\npublic exponent e = 7\nprivate exponent d = 103\npublic key = {n, e} = {143, 7}\nprivate key = {n, d} = {143, 103}\n\nLet's encrypt a secret message msg = 83. Just follow the formula:\n\nencryptedMsg = msge mod n = 837 mod 143 = 27136050989627 mod 143 = 8\n\nNow, let's decrypt the encrypted message back to its original value:\n\ndecryptedMsg = encryptedMsgd mod n = 8103 mod 143 = 1042962419883256876169444192465601618458351817556959360325703910069443225478828393565899456512 mod 143 = 83\n\nThe RSA calculations work correctly. This is because the key-pair meets the RSA property:\n\n(me)d ≡ m (mod n) for all m in the range [0...n)\n(m7)103 ≡ m (mod 143) for all m in the range [0...143)\n\nIn the real world, typically the RSA modulus n and the private exponent d are 3072-bit or 4096-bit integers and the public exponent e is 65537.\nFor further reading, look at this excellent explanation about how RSA works in detail with explainations and examples: http://doctrina.org/How-RSA-Works-With-Examples.html.\nBecause RSA encryption is a deterministic (has no random component) attackers can successfully launch a chosen plaintext attack against by encrypting likely plaintexts with the public key and test if they are equal to the ciphertext.

This is non-trivial and usually involves a design of hybrid encryption scheme, involving ECC cryptography, ECDH key exchange and symmetric encryption algorithm.\nAssume we have a ECC private-public key pair. We want to encrypt and decrypt data using these keys. By definition, asymmetric encryption works as follows: if we encrypt data by a public key, we will be able to decrypt the ciphertext later by the corresponding private key:\n\nThe above process can be directly applied for the RSA cryptosystem, but not for the ECC. The elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) does not directly provide encryption method. Instead, we can design a hybrid encryption scheme by using the ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman) key exchange scheme to derive a shared secret key for symmetric data encryption and decryption.\nThis is how most hybrid encryption schemes works (the encryption process):\n\nThis is how most hybrid encryption schemes works (the decryption process):\n.png>)\nLet's get into details how to design and implement an ECC-based hybrid encryption scheme.\nECC-Based Secret Key Derivation (using ECDH)\nAssume we have a cryptographic elliptic curve over finite field, along with its generator point G. We can use the following two functions to calculate a shared a secret key for encryption and decryption (derived from the ECDH scheme):\n\ncalculateEncryptionKey(pubKey) --> (sharedECCKey, ciphertextPubKey)\nGenerate ciphertextPrivKey = new random private key.\nCalculate ciphertextPubKey = ciphertextPrivKey * G.\nCalculate the ECDH shared secret: sharedECCKey = pubKey * ciphertextPrivKey.\nReturn both the sharedECCKey + ciphertextPubKey. Use the sharedECCKey for symmetric encryption. Use the randomly generated ciphertextPubKey to calculate the decryption key later.\n\n\ncalculateDecryptionKey(privKey, ciphertextPubKey) --> sharedECCKey\nCalculate the the ECDH shared secret: sharedECCKey = ciphertextPubKey * privKey.\nReturn the sharedECCKey and use it for the decryption.\n\n\n\nThe above calculations use the same math, like the ECDH algorithm (see the previous section). Recall that EC points have the following property:\n\n(a * G) * b = (b * G) * a\n\nNow, assume that a = privKey, a * G = pubKey, b = ciphertextPrivKey, b * G = ciphertextPubKey.\nThe above equation takes the following form:\n\npubKey * ciphertextPrivKey = ciphertextPubKey * privKey = sharedECCKey\n\nThis is what exactly the above two functions calculate, directly following the ECDH key agreement scheme. In the hybrid encryption schemes the encapsulated ciphertextPubKey is also known as \"ephemeral key\", because it is used temporary, to derive the symmetric encryption key, using the ECDH key agreement scheme.\nECC-Based Secret Key Derivation - Example in Python\nThe below Python code uses the tinyec library to generate a ECC private-public key pair for the message recipient (based on the brainpoolP256r1 curve) and then derive a secret shared key (for encryption) and ephemeral ciphertext public key (for ECDH) from the recipient's public key and later derive the same secret shared key (for decryption) from the recipient's private key and the generated earlier ephemeral ciphertext public key:\nfrom tinyec import registry\nimport secrets\n\ncurve = registry.get_curve('brainpoolP256r1')\n\ndef compress_point(point):\n    return hex(point.x) + hex(point.y % 2)[2:]\n\ndef ecc_calc_encryption_keys(pubKey):\n    ciphertextPrivKey = secrets.randbelow(curve.field.n)\n    ciphertextPubKey = ciphertextPrivKey * curve.g\n    sharedECCKey = pubKey * ciphertextPrivKey\n    return (sharedECCKey, ciphertextPubKey)\n\ndef ecc_calc_decryption_key(privKey, ciphertextPubKey):\n    sharedECCKey = ciphertextPubKey * privKey\n    return sharedECCKey\n\nprivKey = secrets.randbelow(curve.field.n)\npubKey = privKey * curve.g\nprint(\"private key:\", hex(privKey))\nprint(\"public key:\", compress_point(pubKey))\n\n(encryptKey, ciphertextPubKey) = ecc_calc_encryption_keys(pubKey)\nprint(\"ciphertext pubKey:\", compress_point(ciphertextPubKey))\nprint(\"encryption key:\", compress_point(encryptKey))\n\ndecryptKey = ecc_calc_decryption_key(privKey, ciphertextPubKey)\nprint(\"decryption key:\", compress_point(decryptKey))\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/ECC-based-secret-key-derivation-in-Python.\nThe code is pretty simple and demonstrates that we can generate a pair { secret key + ciphertext public key } from given EC public key and later we can recover the same secret key from the pair { ciphertext public key + private key }. The above code produces output like this:\nprivate key: 0x2e2921b4cde59cdf01e7a014a322abd530b3015085c31cb6e59502da761d29e9\npublic key: 0x850d3873cf4ac50ddb54ddbd27f8225fc43bd3f4c2cc0a4f9d1f9ce15fc4eb711\nciphertext pubKey: 0x71586f9999d3ee050005054bc681c1d96c5eb054ca15b080ba245e495627003b0\nencryption key: 0x9d13d3f8f9747669432f575731926b5ed99a6883f00146cbd3203ffa7ff8b1ae1\ndecryption key: 0x9d13d3f8f9747669432f575731926b5ed99a6883f00146cbd3203ffa7ff8b1ae1\nIt is clear from the above output that the encryption key (derived from the public key) and the decryption key (derived from the corresponding private key) are the same. This is due to the above discussed property of the ECC: pubKey * ciphertextPrivKey = ciphertextPubKey * privKey. These keys will be used for data encryption and decryption in an integrated encryption scheme. The above output will be different if you run the code (due to the randomness used to generate ciphertextPrivKey, but the encryption and decryption keys will always be the same (the ECDH shared secret).\nThe above demonstrated mechanism for generating a shared ephemeral secret key, based on a ECC key pair, is an example of KEM (key encapsulation mechanism), based on the ECC and ECDH.\nECC-Based Hybrid Encryption / Decryption - Example in Python\nOnce we have the secret key, we can use it for symmetric data encryption, using a symmetric encryption scheme like AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305. Let's implement a fully-functional asymmetric ECC encryption and decryption hybrid scheme. It will be based on the brainpoolP256r1 curve and the AES-256-GCM authenticated symmetric cipher.\nWe shall use the tinyec and pycryptodome Python libraries respectively for ECC calculations and for the AES cipher:\npip install tinyec\npip install pycryptodome\nLet's examine this full ECC + AES hybrid encryption example:\nfrom tinyec import registry\nfrom Crypto.Cipher import AES\nimport hashlib, secrets, binascii\n\ndef encrypt_AES_GCM(msg, secretKey):\n    aesCipher = AES.new(secretKey, AES.MODE_GCM)\n    ciphertext, authTag = aesCipher.encrypt_and_digest(msg)\n    return (ciphertext, aesCipher.nonce, authTag)\n\ndef decrypt_AES_GCM(ciphertext, nonce, authTag, secretKey):\n    aesCipher = AES.new(secretKey, AES.MODE_GCM, nonce)\n    plaintext = aesCipher.decrypt_and_verify(ciphertext, authTag)\n    return plaintext\n\ndef ecc_point_to_256_bit_key(point):\n    sha = hashlib.sha256(int.to_bytes(point.x, 32, 'big'))\n    sha.update(int.to_bytes(point.y, 32, 'big'))\n    return sha.digest()\n\ncurve = registry.get_curve('brainpoolP256r1')\n\ndef encrypt_ECC(msg, pubKey):\n    ciphertextPrivKey = secrets.randbelow(curve.field.n)\n    sharedECCKey = ciphertextPrivKey * pubKey\n    secretKey = ecc_point_to_256_bit_key(sharedECCKey)\n    ciphertext, nonce, authTag = encrypt_AES_GCM(msg, secretKey)\n    ciphertextPubKey = ciphertextPrivKey * curve.g\n    return (ciphertext, nonce, authTag, ciphertextPubKey)\n\ndef decrypt_ECC(encryptedMsg, privKey):\n    (ciphertext, nonce, authTag, ciphertextPubKey) = encryptedMsg\n    sharedECCKey = privKey * ciphertextPubKey\n    secretKey = ecc_point_to_256_bit_key(sharedECCKey)\n    plaintext = decrypt_AES_GCM(ciphertext, nonce, authTag, secretKey)\n    return plaintext\n\nmsg = b'Text to be encrypted by ECC public key and ' \\\n      b'decrypted by its corresponding ECC private key'\nprint(\"original msg:\", msg)\nprivKey = secrets.randbelow(curve.field.n)\npubKey = privKey * curve.g\n\nencryptedMsg = encrypt_ECC(msg, pubKey)\nencryptedMsgObj = {\n    'ciphertext': binascii.hexlify(encryptedMsg[0]),\n    'nonce': binascii.hexlify(encryptedMsg[1]),\n    'authTag': binascii.hexlify(encryptedMsg[2]),\n    'ciphertextPubKey': hex(encryptedMsg[3].x) + hex(encryptedMsg[3].y % 2)[2:]\n}\nprint(\"encrypted msg:\", encryptedMsgObj)\n\ndecryptedMsg = decrypt_ECC(encryptedMsg, privKey)\nprint(\"decrypted msg:\", decryptedMsg)\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/ECC-based-hybrid-encryption-decryption-in-Python.\nThe above example starts from generating an ECC public + private key pair for the message recipient: pubKey + privKey, using the tinyec library. These keys will be used to encrypt the message msg through the hybrid encryption scheme (asymmetric ECC + symmetric AES) and to decrypt is later back to its original form.\nNext, we encrypt msg by using the pubKey and we obtain as a result the following set of output: { ciphertext, nonce, authTag, ciphertextPubKey }. The ciphertext is obtained by the symmetric AES-GCM encryption, along with the nonce (random AES initialization vector) and authTag (the MAC code of the encrypted text, obtained by the GCM block mode). Additionally, we obtain a randomly generated ephemeral public key ciphertextPubKey, which will be encapsulated in the encrypted message and will be used to recover the AES symmetric key during the decryption (using the ECDH key agreement scheme, as it was show before).\nTo decrypt the encrypted message, we use the data produced during the encryption { ciphertext, nonce, authTag, ciphertextPubKey }, along with the decryption privateKey. The result is the decrypted plaintext message. We use authenticated encryption (GCM block mode), so if the decryption key or some other parameter is incorrect, the decryption will fail with an exception.\nInternally, the encrypt_ECC(msg, pubKey) function first generates an ephemeral ECC key-pair for the ciphertext and calculates the symmetric encryption shared ECC key sharedECCKey = ciphertextPrivKey * pubKey. This key is an EC point, so it is then transformed to 256-bit AES secret key (integer) though hashing the point's x and y coordinates. Finally, the AES-256-GCM cipher (from pycryptodome) encrypts the message by the 256-bit shared secret key secretKey and produces as output ciphertext + nonce + authTag.\nThe decrypt_ECC(encryptedMsg{ciphertext, nonce, authTag, ciphertextPubKey}, privKey) function internally first calculates the symmetric encryption shared ECC key sharedECCKey = privKey * ciphertextPubKey. It is an EC point, so it should be first transformed to 256-bit AES secret key though hashing the point's x and y coordinates. Then the AES-256-GCM cipher is used to decrypt the ciphertext + nonce + authTag by the 256-bit shared secret key secretKey. The produced output is the original plaintext message (or an exception in case of incorrect decryption key or unmatching authTag).\nThe output from the above code looks like this:\noriginal msg: b'Text to be encrypted by ECC public key and decrypted by its corresponding ECC private key'\nencrypted msg: {'ciphertext': b'b5953b3082fcefdbde91dd3c03cf83dde0822c19be6ae906a634db65115295e7cbcd7a1a492d69ba5be91990c70d8df9dc84360cf554f155ef81ce1f0ad44bd9fdabbc5f960517089262b3390e61b37610012bee4e6bcae335', 'nonce': b'9d55f4b5c87fff773d0457f3b23a953e', 'authTag': b'5c9d339778925aa4e44f43252a28681d', 'ciphertextPubKey': '0x21dbc985b625f2a42d0f86fc234b49b55477928bae73dfac73bafd9bed50abe70'}\ndecrypted msg: b'Text to be encrypted by ECC public key and decrypted by its corresponding ECC private key'\nEnjoy the above example, play with it, try to understand how exactly it works, try to change the underlying ECC curve, try to change the symmetric encryption algorithm, try to decrypt the ciphertext with wrong private key.\n"},"asymmetric-key-ciphers/ecies-public-key-encryption.html":{"url":"asymmetric-key-ciphers/ecies-public-key-encryption.html","title":"ECIES Hybrid Encryption Scheme","keywords":"","body":"ECIES Hybrid Encryption Scheme\nA hybrid encryption scheme similar to the previously demonstrated code is standardized under the name Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES) in many crypto standards like SECG SEC-1, ISO/IEC 18033-2, IEEE 1363a and ANSI X9.63. ECIES is a public-key authenticated encryption scheme, which works similarly to the above code examples, but uses a KDF (key-derivation function) for deriving separate MAC key and symmetric encryption key from the ECDH shared secret. It has many variants.\nThe ECIES standard combines ECC-based asymmetric cryptography with symmetric ciphers to provide data encryption by EC private key and decryption by the corresponding EC public key. The ECIES encryption scheme uses ECC cryptography (public key cryptosystem) + key-derivation function (KDF) + symmetric encryption algorithm + MAC algorithm, combined together like it is shown on the figure below:\n\nThe input of the ECIES encryption consists of recipient's public key + plain text message.

Digital signatures provide:\n\nMessage authentication - a proof that certain known sender (secret key owner) have created and signed the message.\nМessage integrity - a proof that the message was not altered after the signing.\nNon-repudiation - the signer cannot deny the signing of the document after the signature is once created.\n\nDigital signatures are widely used today in the business and in the financial industry, e.g. for authorizing bank payments (money transfer), for exchange of signed electronic documents, for signing transactions in the public blockchain systems (e.g. transfer of coins, tokens or other digital assets), for signing digital contracts and in many other scenarios.\nDigital signatures cannot identify who is the person, created a certain signature. This can be solved in combination with a digital certificate, which binds a public key owner with identity (person, organization, web site or other). By design digital signatures bind messages to public keys, not to digital identities.\nSign Messages and Verify Signatures: How It Works?\nDigital signature schemes typically use a public-key cryptosystem (such as RSA or ECC) and use a public / private key pairs. A message is signed by a private key and the signature is verified by the corresponding public key:\n\nMessages are signed by the sender using a private key (signing key). Typically the input message is hashed and then the signature is calculated by the signing algorithm. Most signature algorithms perform some calculation with the message hash + the signing key in a way that the result cannot be calculated without the signing key. The result from message signing is the digital signature (one or more integers):\nsignMsg(msg, privKey) 🡒 signature\nMessage signatures are verified by the corresponding public key (verification key). Typically the signed message is hashed and some calculation is performed by the signature algorithm using the message hash + the public key. The result from signing is a boolean value (valid or invalid signature):\nverifyMsgSignature(msg, signature, pubKey) 🡒 valid / invalid\nA message signature mathematically guarantees that certain message was signed by certain (secret) private key, which corresponds to certain (non-secret) public key. After a message is signed, the message and the signature cannot be modified and thus message authentication and integrity is guaranteed. Anyone, who knows the public key of the message signer, can verify the signature. Аfter signing the signature author cannot reject the act of signing (this is known as non-repudiation).\nMost signature schemes work like it is shown at the following diagram:\\\nAt signing, the input message is hashed (either alone, or together with the public key and other input parameters), then some computation (based on elliptic curves, discrete logarithms or other cryptographic primitive) calculates the digital signature. The produced signed message consists of the original message + the calculated signature.\nAt signature verification, the message for verification is hashed (either alone or together with the public key) and some computations are performed between the message hash, the digital signature and the public key, and finally a comparison decides whether the signature is valid or not.\nDigital signatures are different from MAC (message authentication codes), because MACs are created and verified by the same secret key using a symmetric algorithm, while digital signatures are created by a signing key and are verified by a different verification key, corresponding to the signing key using an asymmetric algorithm. Both signatures and MAC codes provide message authentication and integrity.\nDigital Signature Schemes and Algorithms\nMost public-key cryptosystems like RSA and ECC provide secure digital signature schemes (signature algorithms). Examples of well known digital signature schemes are: DSA, ECDSA, EdDSA, RSA signatures#Signing_messages), ElGamal signatures and Schnorr signatures.\nThe above mentioned signature schemes are based on the difficulty of the DLP (discrete logarithm problem) and ECDLP (elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem) and are quantum-breakable (powerful enough quantum computers may calculate the signing key from the message signature). Quantum-safe signatures (like SPHINCS, BLISS and XMSS) are not massively used, because of long key length, long signatures and slower performance, compared to ECDSA and EdDSA.\nThe most popular digital signature schemes (as of Nov 2018) are: RSA signatures#Signing_messages), ECDSA and EdDSA. Let's give some details about them, along with some live code examples.\nRSA Signatures\nThe RSA public-key cryptosystem provides a cryptographically secure digital signature scheme (sign + verify), based on the math of the modular exponentiations and discrete logarithms and the difficulty of the integer factorization problem (IFP). The RSA sign / verify process works as follows:\n\nThe RSA sign#Signing_messages) algorithm computes a message hash, then encrypts the hash with the private key exponent to obtain the signature. The obtained signature is an integer number (the RSA encrypted message hash).\nThe RSA verify algorithm first computes the message hash, then decrypts the message signature with the public key exponent and compares the obtained decrypted hash with the hash of the signed message to ensure the signature is valid.\n\nRSA signatures are deterministic (the same message + same private key produce the same signature). A non-deterministic variant of RSA-signatures is easy to be designed by padding the input message with some random bytes before signing.\nRSA signatures are widely used in modern cryptography, e.g. for signing digital certificates to protect Web sites. For example (as of Nov 2018) the Microsoft's official Web site uses Sha256RSA for its digital certificate. Nevertheless, the trend in the last decade is to move from RSA and DSA to elliptic curve-based signatures (like ECDSA and EdDSA). Modern cryptographers and developers prefer ECC signatures for their shorter key length, shorter signature, higher security (for the same key length) and better performance.\nDSA (Digital Signature Algorithm)\nThe DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) is a cryptographically secure standard for digital signatures (signing messages and signature verification), based on the math of the modular exponentiations and discrete logarithms and the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem (DLP). It is alternative of RSA and is used instead of RSA, because of patents limitations with RSA (until Sept 2000). DSA is variant of the ElGamal signature scheme. The DSA sign / verify process works as follows:\n\nThe DSA signing algorithm computes a message hash, then generates a random integer k and computes the signature (а pair of integers {r, s}), where r is computed from k and s is computed using the message hash + the private key exponent + the random number k. Due to randomness, the signature is non-deterministic.\nThe DSA signature verification algorithm involves computations, based on the message hash + the public key exponent + the signature {r, s}.\n\nThe random value k (generated when the signature is computed) opens a potential vulnerability: if two different messages are signed using the same value of k and the same private key, then an attacker can compute the signer's private key directly (see https://github.com/tintinweb/ecdsa-private-key-recovery).\nA deterministic-DSA variant is defined in RFC 6979, which calculates the random number k as HMAC from the private key, the message hash and few other parameters. The deterministic DSA is considered more secure.\nIn the modern cryptography, the elliptic-curve-based signatures (liike ECDSA and EdDSA) are prefered to DSA, because of shorter key lengths, shorter signature lengths, higher security levels (for the same key length) and better performance.\nECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)\nThe ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) is a cryptographically secure digital signature scheme, based on the elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC). ECDSA relies on the math of the cyclic groups of elliptic curves over finite fields and on the difficulty of the ECDLP problem (elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem).\nECDSA is adaptation of the classical DSA algorithm, which is derived from the ElGamal signature scheme. More precisely, the ECDSA algorithm is a variant of the ElGamal signature, with some changes and optimizations to handle the representation of the group elements (the points of the elliptic curve). Like any other elliptic curve crypto algorithm, ECDSA uses an elliptic curve (like the secp256k1), private key (random integer within the curve key length - for signing messages) and public key (EC point, calculated from the private key by multiplying it to the curve generator point - for verifying signatures). The ECDSA sign / verify process works as follows:\n\nThe ECDSA signing algorithm computes a message hash, then generates a random integer k and computes the signature (a pair of integers {r, s}), where r is computed from k and s is computed using the message hash + the private key + the random number k. Due to the randomness, the signature is non-deterministic.\nThe ECDSA signature verification algorithm involves computations, based on the message hash + the public key + the signature {r, s}.\n\nThe random value k (generated when the signature is computed) opens a potential vulnerability: if two different messages are signed using the same value of k and the same private key, then an attacker can compute the signer's private key directly (see https://github.com/tintinweb/ecdsa-private-key-recovery).\nA deterministic-ECDSA variant is defined in RFC 6979, which calculates the random number k as HMAC from the private key + the message hash + few other parameters. The deterministic ECDSA is considered more secure.\nECDSA signatures are the most widely used signing algorithm, used by millions every day (as of Nov 2018). For example, the digital certificates in Amazon Web sites are signed by the Sha256ECDSA signature scheme.\nEdDSA (Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm)\nEdDSA (Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm) is a fast digital signature algorithm, using elliptic curves in Edwards form (like Ed25519 and Ed448-Goldilocks), a deterministic variant of the Schnorr's signature scheme, designed by a team of the well-known cryptographer Daniel Bernstein.\nEdDSA is more simple than ECDSA, more secure than ECDSA and is designed to be faster than ECDSA (for curves with comparables key length). Like ECDSA, the EdDSA signature scheme relies on the difficulty of the ECDLP problem (elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem) for its security strength.\nThe EdDSA signature algorithm is works with Edwards elliptic curves like Curve25519 and Curve448, which are highly optimized for performance and security. It is shown that Ed25519 signatures are typically faster than traditional ECDSA signatures over curves with comparable key length. Still, the performance competition is disputable. The EdDSA sign / verify process works as follows:\n\nThe EdDSA signing algorithm generates a deterministic (not random) integer r (computed by hashing the message and the hash of the private key), then computes the signature {Rs, s}, where Rs is computed from r and s is computed from the hash of (the message + the public key derived from the private + the number r) + the private key. The signature is deterministic (the same message signed by the same key always gives the same signature).\nThe EdDSA signature verification algorithm involves elliptic-curve computations, based on the message (hashed together with the public key and the EC point Rs from the signature) + the public key + the number s from the signature {Rs, s}.\n\nBy design EdDSA signatures are deterministic (which improves their security). A non-deterministic variant of EdDSA-signatures is easy to be designed by padding the input message with some random bytes before signing.\nA short comparison between Ed25519 EdDSA signatures and secp256k ECDSA signatures is given below:\n\n\n\n\nEdDSA-Ed25519\nECDSA-secp256k1\n\n\n\n\nPerformance (source)\n8% faster\n8% slower\n\n\nPrivate key length\n32 bytes (256 bits = 251 variable bits + 5 predefined)\n32 bytes (256 bits)\n\n\nPublic key length (compressed)\n32 bytes (256 bits = 255-bit y-coordinate + 1-bit x coordinate)\n33 bytes (257 bits = 256-bit x-coordinate + 1-bit y-coordinate)\n\n\nSignature size\n64 bytes (512 bits)\n64 bytes (512 bits) or 65 bytes (513 bits) with the public key recovery bit\n\n\nPublic key recovery\nnot possible (signature verification involves hasing of the public key)\npossible (with 1 recovery bit added in the signature)\n\n\nSecurity level (source)\n~128 bit (more precisely 125.8)\n~128 bit (more precisely 127.8)\n\n\nSafeCurves security (source)\n11 of 11 tests passed\n7 of 11 tests passed\n\n\n\nModern developers often use Ed25519 signatures instead of 256-bit curve ECDSA signatures, because EdDSA-Ed25519 signature scheme uses keys, which fit in 32 bytes (64 hex digits), signatures fit in 64 bytes (128 hex digits), signing and verification is faster and the security is considered better.\nPublic blockchains (like Bitcoin and Ethereum) often use secp2561-based ECDSA signatures, because the signer's public key (and its blockchain address) can be easily recovered from the signature (together with the signed message) by adding just 1 additional bit to the signature.\nIn the general case, it is considered that EdDSA signatures are recommended to ECDSA, but this is highly disputable and depends on the use case, on the curves involved and many other parameters.\nOther Signature Schemes and Algorithms\nMost signature algorithms are derived from generic signature schemes like ElGamal signatures and Schnorr signatures.\n\nRSA signature is derived from the RSA encryption scheme.\nDSA and ECDSA are derived from ElGamal signature scheme.\nEdDSA is derived from the Schnorr signature scheme.\n\nOther signature schemes include:\n\nECGDSA: an elliptic-curve digital signature scheme (based on the difficulty of the ECDLP problem), a slightly simplified variant of ECDSA, known as the German version of ECDSA.\nECKDSA: an elliptic-curve digital signature scheme (based on the difficulty of the ECDLP problem), a complicated variant of ECDSA, known as the Korean version of ECDSA. The ECKDSA signs given message by given EC private key, along with the signer's digital certificate hash. This add identity to the digital signature, in addition to message authentication, integrity and non-repudiation.\nSM2 signature: an elliptic-curve digital signature scheme (based on the difficulty of the ECDLP problem), known as the Chinese digital signature algorithm, developed by the Chinese Academy of Science.\nGOST R 34.10-2001: an elliptic-curve digital signature scheme (based on the difficulty of the ECDLP problem), known as the Russian digital signature algorithm, one of the Russian cryptographic standard algorithms (called GOST algorithms).\n\nAfter the short review of the most popular digital signature algorithms, let's get into technical details about the RSA sign, ECDSA and EdDSA signature algorithms, with code examples.\n"},"digital-signatures/rsa-sign-verify-examples.html":{"url":"digital-signatures/rsa-sign-verify-examples.html","title":"RSA: Sign / Verify - Examples","keywords":"","body":"RSA: Sign / Verify - Examples\nLet's demonstrate in practice the RSA sign / verify algorithm. We shall use the pycryptodome package in Python to generate RSA keys. After the keys are generated, we shall compute RSA digital signatures and verify signatures by a simple modular exponentiation (by encrypting and decrypting the message hash).\npip install pycryptodome\n\nNext, generate a 1024-bit RSA key-pair:\nfrom Crypto.PublicKey import RSA\n\nkeyPair = RSA.generate(bits=1024)\nprint(f\"Public key:  (n={hex(keyPair.n)}, e={hex(keyPair.e)})\")\nprint(f\"Private key: (n={hex(keyPair.n)}, d={hex(keyPair.d)})\")\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/RSA-key-in-Python.\nThe output from the above code might look like this (it will be different at each execution due to randomness):\nPublic key:  (n=0xf51518d30754430e4b89f828fd4f1a8e8f44dd10e0635c0e93b7c01802729a37e1dfc8848d7fbbdf2599830268d544c1ecab4f2b19b6164a4ac29c8b1a4ec6930047397d0bb93aa77ed0c2f5d5c90ff3d458755b2367b46cc5c0d83f8f8673ec85b0575b9d1cea2c35a0b881a6d007d95c1cc94892bec61c2e9ed1599c1e605f, e=0x10001)\nPrivate key: (n=0xf51518d30754430e4b89f828fd4f1a8e8f44dd10e0635c0e93b7c01802729a37e1dfc8848d7fbbdf2599830268d544c1ecab4f2b19b6164a4ac29c8b1a4ec6930047397d0bb93aa77ed0c2f5d5c90ff3d458755b2367b46cc5c0d83f8f8673ec85b0575b9d1cea2c35a0b881a6d007d95c1cc94892bec61c2e9ed1599c1e605f, d=0x165ecc9b4689fc6ceb9c3658977686f8083fc2e5ed75644bb8540766a9a2884d1d82edac9bb5d312353e63e4ee68b913f264589f98833459a7a547e0b2900a33e71023c4dedb42875b2dfdf412881199a990dfb77c097ce71b9c8b8811480f1637b85900137231ab47a7e0cbecc0b011c2c341b6de2b2e9c24d455ccd1fc0c21)\nNow, let's sign a message, using the RSA private key {n, d}. Calculate its hash and raise the hash to the power d modulo n (encrypt the hash by the private key). We shall use SHA-512 hash. It will fit in the current RSA key size (1024). In Python we have modular exponentiation as built in function pow(x, y, n):\n# RSA sign the message\nmsg = b'A message for signing'\nfrom hashlib import sha512\nhash = int.from_bytes(sha512(msg).digest(), byteorder='big')\nsignature = pow(hash, keyPair.d, keyPair.n)\nprint(\"Signature:\", hex(signature))\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/RSA-sign-in-Python.\nThe obtained digital signature is an integer in the range of the RSA key length [0...n). For the above private key and the above message, the obtained signature looks like this:\nSignature: 0x650c9f2e6701e3fe73d3054904a9a4bbdb96733f1c4c743ef573ad6ac14c5a3bf8a4731f6e6276faea5247303677fb8dbdf24ff78e53c25052cdca87eecfee85476bcb8a05cb9a1efef7cb87dd68223e117ce800ac46177172544757a487be32f5ab8fe0879fa8add78be465ea8f8d5acf977e9f1ae36d4d47816ea6ed41372b\nThe signature is 1024-bit integer (128 bytes, 256 hex digits). This signature size corresponds to the RSA key size.\nNow, let's verify the signature, by decrypting the signature using the public key (raise the signature to power e modulo n) and comparing the obtained hash from the signature to the hash of the originally signed message:\n# RSA verify signature\nmsg = b'A message for signing'\nhash = int.from_bytes(sha512(msg).digest(), byteorder='big')\nhashFromSignature = pow(signature, keyPair.e, keyPair.n)\nprint(\"Signature valid:\", hash == hashFromSignature)\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/RSA-sign-verify-in-Python.\nThe output will show True, because the signature will be valid:\nSignature valid: True\nNow, let's try to tamper the message and verify the signature again:\n# RSA verify signature (tampered msg)\nmsg = b'A message for signing (tampered)'\nhash = int.from_bytes(sha512(msg).digest(), byteorder='big')\nhashFromSignature = pow(signature, keyPair.e, keyPair.n)\nprint(\"Signature valid (tampered):\", hash == hashFromSignature)\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/RSA-verify-tampered-message-in-Python.\nNow, the signature will be invalid and the output from the above code will be:\nSignature valid (tampered): False\nEnjoy playing with the above RSA sign / verify examples. Try to modify the code, e.g. use 4096-bit keys, try to tamper the public key at the signature verification step or the signature.\nThe RSA Signature Standard PKCS#1\nThe simple use of RSA signatures is demonstrated above, but the industry usually follows the crypto standards. For the RSA signatures, the most adopted standard is \"PKCS#1\", which has several versions (1.5, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2), the latest described in RFC 8017. The PKCS#1 standard defines the RSA signing algorithm (RSASP1) and the RSA signature verification algorithm (RSAVP1), which are almost the same like the implemented in the previous section.\nTo demonstrate the PKCS#1 RSA digital signatures, we shall use the following code, based on the pycryptodome Python library, which implements RSA sign / verify, following the PKCS#1 v1.5 specification:\nfrom Crypto.PublicKey import RSA\nfrom Crypto.Signature.pkcs1_15 import PKCS115_SigScheme\nfrom Crypto.Hash import SHA256\nimport binascii\n\n# Generate 1024-bit RSA key pair (private + public key)\nkeyPair = RSA.generate(bits=1024)\npubKey = keyPair.publickey()\n\n# Sign the message using the PKCS#1 v1.5 signature scheme (RSASP1)\nmsg = b'Message for RSA signing'\nhash = SHA256.new(msg)\nsigner = PKCS115_SigScheme(keyPair)\nsignature = signer.sign(hash)\nprint(\"Signature:\", binascii.hexlify(signature))\n\n# Verify valid PKCS#1 v1.5 signature (RSAVP1)\nmsg = b'Message for RSA signing'\nhash = SHA256.new(msg)\nverifier = PKCS115_SigScheme(pubKey)\ntry:\n    verifier.verify(hash, signature)\n    print(\"Signature is valid.\")\nexcept:\n    print(\"Signature is invalid.\")\n\n# Verify invalid PKCS#1 v1.5 signature (RSAVP1)\nmsg = b'A tampered message'\nhash = SHA256.new(msg)\nverifier = PKCS115_SigScheme(pubKey)\ntry:\n    verifier.verify(hash, signature)\n    print(\"Signature is valid.\")\nexcept:\n    print(\"Signature is invalid.\")\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/PKCShash1-in-Python.\nThe output from the above code demonstrates that the PKCS#1 RSA signing with 1024-bit RSA private key produces 1024-bit digital signature and that it is successfully validated afterwards with the corresponding public key. If the message or the signature or the public key is tampered, the signature fails to validate. The output from the above example looks like this:\nSignature: b'243b9ed6561ab3bddead98508af0ac34b4567b1358011ace24db71ce2bc7f1a2e942b6231aa84cb07bae85b668d7c7cd0bc40cdda6f8162de57f0ee842e589c58f94aa4f96d51355f8aa395d7db950ebb9d375fca3124b6222699a645e93287bc6f5eb5b750fc0b470588f949a887dff75ed42cf01d9642a5d497f609b8cd043'\nSignature is valid.\nSignature is invalid.\nNote that in real-world applications the RSA key length should be at least 3072 bits to provide secure enough signatures.\n"},"digital-signatures/exercises-rsa-sign-and-verify.html":{"url":"digital-signatures/exercises-rsa-sign-and-verify.html","title":"Exercises: RSA Sign and Verify","keywords":"","body":"Exercises: RSA Sign and Verify\nExercises: RSA Sign / Verify\nIn this exercise we shall sign messages and verify signatures using the PKCS#1 v.1.5 RSA signature algorithm with 4096-bit keys, following the technical specification from RFC 8017, using SHA3-512 for hashing the input message.

Examples","keywords":"","body":"ECDSA: Sign / Verify - Examples\nAfter we explained in details how the ECDSA signature algorithm works, now let's demonstrate it in practice with code examples.\nIn this example, we shall use the pycoin Python package, which implements the ECDSA signature algorithm with the curve secp256k1 (used in the Bitcoin cryptography), as well as many other functionalities related to the Bitcoin blockchain:\npip install pycoin\n\nECDSA Sign / Verify using the secp256k1 Curve and SHA3-256\nFirst, define the functions for hashing, ECDSA signing and ECDSA signature verification:\nfrom pycoin.ecdsa import generator_secp256k1, sign, verify\nimport hashlib, secrets\n\ndef sha3_256Hash(msg):\n    hashBytes = hashlib.sha3_256(msg.encode(\"utf8\")).digest()\n    return int.from_bytes(hashBytes, byteorder=\"big\")\n\ndef signECDSAsecp256k1(msg, privKey):\n    msgHash = sha3_256Hash(msg)\n    signature = sign(generator_secp256k1, privKey, msgHash)\n    return signature\n\ndef verifyECDSAsecp256k1(msg, signature, pubKey):\n    msgHash = sha3_256Hash(msg)\n    valid = verify(generator_secp256k1, pubKey, msgHash, signature)\n    return valid\n\nThe hashing function sha3_256Hash(msg) computes and returns a SHA3-256 hash, represented as 256-bit integer number. It will be used in the sign / verify processes later.\nThe signECDSAsecp256k1(msg, privKey) function takes a text message and 256-bit secp256k1 private key and calculates the ECDSA signature {r, s} and returns it as pair of 256-bit integers. The ECDSA signature, generated by the pycoin library by default is deterministic, as described in RFC 6979.\nThe verifyECDSAsecp256k1(msg, signature, pubKey) function takes a text message, a ECDSA signature {r, s} and a 2*256-bit ECDSA public key (uncompressed) and returns whether the signature is valid or not.\nNow let's demonstrate the above defined functions to sign a message and verify its signature:\n# ECDSA sign message (using the curve secp256k1 + SHA3-256)\nmsg = \"Message for ECDSA signing\"\nprivKey = secrets.randbelow(generator_secp256k1.order())\nsignature = signECDSAsecp256k1(msg, privKey)\nprint(\"Message:\", msg)\nprint(\"Private key:\", hex(privKey))\nprint(\"Signature: r=\" + hex(signature[0]) + \", s=\" + hex(signature[1]))\n\n# ECDSA verify signature (using the curve secp256k1 + SHA3-256)\npubKey = (generator_secp256k1 * privKey).pair()\nvalid = verifyECDSAsecp256k1(msg, signature, pubKey)\nprint(\"\\nMessage:\", msg)\nprint(\"Public key: (\" + hex(pubKey[0]) + \", \" + hex(pubKey[1]) + \")\")\nprint(\"Signature valid?\", valid)\n\n# ECDSA verify tampered signature (using the curve secp256k1 + SHA3-256)\nmsg = \"Tampered message\"\nvalid = verifyECDSAsecp256k1(msg, signature, pubKey)\nprint(\"\\nMessage:\", msg)\nprint(\"Signature (tampered msg) valid?\", valid)\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/ECDSA-sign-verify-in-Python.\nThe output from the above code is like this:\nMessage: Message for ECDSA signing\nPrivate key: 0x79afbf7147841fca72b45a1978dd7669470ba67abbe5c220062924380c9c364b\nSignature: r=0xb83380f6e1d09411ebf49afd1a95c738686bfb2b0fe2391134f4ae3d6d77b78a, s=0x6c305afcac930a3ea1721c04d8a1a979016baae011319746323a756fbaee1811\n\nMessage: Message for ECDSA signing\nPublic key: (0x3804a19f2437f7bba4fcfbc194379e43e514aa98073db3528ccdbdb642e240, 0x6b22d833b9a502b0e10e58aac485aa357bccd1df6ec0fa4d398908c1ac1920bc)\nSignature valid? True\n\nMessage: Tampered message\nSignature (tampered msg) valid? False\nAs it is visible from the above output, the random generated secp256k1 private key is 64 hex digits (256 bits). After signing, the obtained signature {r, s} consists of 2 * 256-bit integers. The public key, obtained by multiplying the private key by the curve generator point, consists of 2 * 256 bits (uncompressed). The produced ECDSA digital signature verifies correctly after signing. If the message is tampered, the signature fails to verify.\nPublic Key Recovery from the ECDSA Signature\nAs we already know, in ECDSA it is possible to recover the public key from signature. Let's demonstrate this by adding the following code at the end of the previous example:\nfrom pycoin.ecdsa import possible_public_pairs_for_signature\n\ndef recoverPubKeyFromSignature(msg, signature):\n    msgHash = sha3_256Hash(msg)\n    recoveredPubKeys = possible_public_pairs_for_signature(\n        generator_secp256k1, msgHash, signature)\n    return recoveredPubKeys\n\nmsg = \"Message for ECDSA signing\"\nrecoveredPubKeys = recoverPubKeyFromSignature(msg, signature)\nprint(\"\\nMessage:\", msg)\nprint(\"Signature: r=\" + hex(signature[0]) + \", s=\" + hex(signature[1]))\nfor pk in recoveredPubKeys:\n    print(\"Recovered public key from signature: (\" +\n          hex(pk[0]) + \", \" + hex(pk[1]) + \")\")\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/ECDSA-public-key-recovery-in-Python.\nThe above code recovers the all possible EC public keys from the ECDSA signature + the signed message, using the algorithm, described in http://www.secg.org/sec1-v2.pdf. Note that multiple EC public keys (0, 1 or 2) may match the message + signature. The expected output from the above code (together with the previous code) looks like this:\nMessage: Message for ECDSA signing\nPrivate key: 0xc374556584db050001c2c9265b546e66d3dbbe8239d17427c176d834a19638dc\nSignature: r=0xd034c98af3274ad93f3c8ce944bbc17b11b6aa170c5f097ed98687fa0d93347c, s=0xa2318ceea2002caba38efbba3bf8ef8d43236a6edc33c040734d8eb2ed77f608\n\nMessage: Message for ECDSA signing\nPublic key: (0x10b5d9028ec828a0f9111e36f046afa5a0c677357351093426bcec10c663db7d, 0x271763c56fcd87b72d59ceaa5b9c3fd2122788fe344751a9bde373f903e5bb20)\nSignature valid?

To avoid this ambiguity, the signature can be extended to hold {r, s, v}, where v holds the parity of the y coordinate of the random point R from the ECDSA signing algorithm. This coordinate is lost, because the ECDSA signature takes just the x coordinate or R.\nPublic Key Recovery from Extended ECDSA Signature\nTo recover with confidence the public key from ECDSA signature + message, we need a library that generates extended ECDSA signatures {r, s, v} and supports internally the public key recovery. Let's play with the eth_keys Python library:\npip install eth_keys\n\nThe eth_keys is part of the Ethereum project and implements secp256k1-based ECC cryptography, private and public keys, ECDSA extended signatures {r, s, v} and Ethereum blockchain addresses. The following example demonstrates private key generation, message signing, public key recovery from signature + message and signature verification:\nimport eth_keys, os\n\n# Generate the private + public key pair (using the secp256k1 curve)\nsignerPrivKey = eth_keys.keys.PrivateKey(os.urandom(32))\nsignerPubKey = signerPrivKey.public_key\nprint('Private key (64 hex digits):', signerPrivKey)\nprint('Public key (uncompressed, 128 hex digits):', signerPubKey)\n\n# ECDSA sign message (using the curve secp256k1 + Keccak-256)\nmsg = b'Message for signing'\nsignature = signerPrivKey.sign_msg(msg)\nprint('Message:', msg)\nprint('Signature: [r = {0}, s = {1}, v = {2}]'.format(\n    hex(signature.r), hex(signature.s), hex(signature.v)))\n\n# ECDSA public key recovery from signature + verify signature\n# (using the curve secp256k1 + Keccak-256 hash)\nmsg = b'Message for signing'\nrecoveredPubKey = signature.recover_public_key_from_msg(msg)\nprint('Recovered public key (128 hex digits):', recoveredPubKey)\nprint('Public key correct?', recoveredPubKey == signerPubKey)\nvalid = signerPubKey.verify_msg(msg, signature)\nprint(\"Signature valid?\", valid)\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/ECDSA-public-key-recovery-extended-in-Python.\nThe output from the above code looks like this:\nPrivate key (64 hex digits): 0x68abc765746a33272e47b0a96a0b4184048f70354221e04219fbc223bfe79794\nPublic key (uncompressed, 128 hex digits): 0x30a6dc572da312587144e7ccda1e9abd901323adebe7091bb4985e1202c2a10bc25f681b3d2e1a671438f0b125287b473c09ca345c5583cd627232b536b9ca0a\nMessage: b'Message for signing'\nSignature: [r = 0x4cddf146c578d20a31fa6128e5d9afe6ac666e5ef5899f2767cacb56a42703cc, s = 0x3847036857aa3f077a2e142eee707e5af2653baa99b9d10764a0be3d61595dbb, v = 0x0]\nRecovered public key (128 hex digits): 0x30a6dc572da312587144e7ccda1e9abd901323adebe7091bb4985e1202c2a10bc25f681b3d2e1a671438f0b125287b473c09ca345c5583cd627232b536b9ca0a\nPublic key correct? True\nSignature valid? True\nThe public key recovery will always be successful, because there is no ambiguity with the extended ECDSA signature. The signature verification will be successful, unless the message, the public key or the signature is tampered. You are free to play with the above code, to change it, to tamper the signed message and to see what happens.

The EdDSA signatures use the Edwards form of the elliptic curves (for performance reasons), respectively edwards25519 and edwards448. The EdDSA algorithm is based on the Schnorr signature algorithm and relies on the difficulty of the ECDLP problem.\nThe EdDSA signature algorithm and its variants Ed25519 and Ed448 are technically described in the RFC 8032.\nEdDSA Key Generation\nEd25519 and Ed448 use small private keys (32 or 57 bytes respectively), small public keys (32 or 57 bytes) and small signatures (64 or 114 bytes) with high security level at the same time (128-bit or 224-bit respectively).\nAssume the elliptic curve for the EdDSA algorithm comes with a generator point G and a subgroup order q for the EC points, generated from G.\nThe EdDSA key-pair consists of:\n\nprivate key (integer): privKey\npublic key (EC point): pubKey = privKey * G\n\nThe private key is generated from a random integer, known as seed (which should have similar bit length, like the curve order). The seed is first hashed, then the last few bits, corresponding to the curve cofactor (8 for Ed25519 and 4 for X448) are cleared, then the highest bit is cleared and the second highest bit is set. These transformations guarantee that the private key will always belong to the same subgroup of EC points on the curve and that the private keys will always have similar bit length (to protect from timing-based side-channel attacks). For Ed25519 the private key is 32 bytes. For Ed448 the private key is 57 bytes.\nThe public key pubKey is a point on the elliptic curve, calculated by the EC point multiplication: pubKey = privKey * G (the private key, multiplied by the generator point G for the curve). The public key is encoded as compressed EC point: the y-coordinate, combined with the lowest bit (the parity) of the x-coordinate. For Ed25519 the public key is 32 bytes. For Ed448 the public key is 57 bytes.\nEdDSA Sign\nThe EdDSA signing algorithm (RFC 8032) takes as input a text message msg + the signer's EdDSA private key privKey and produces as output a pair of integers {R, s}. EdDSA signing works as follows (with minor simplifications):\nEdDSA_sign(msg, privKey) --> { R, s }\n\nCalculate pubKey = privKey * G\nDeterministically generate a secret integer r = hash(hash(privKey) + msg) mod q (this is a bit simplified)\nCalculate the public key point behind r by multiplying it by the curve generator: R = r * G\nCalculate h = hash(R + pubKey + msg) mod q\nCalculate s = (r + h * privKey) mod q\nReturn the signature { R, s }\n\nThe produced digital signature is 64 bytes (32 + 32 bytes) for Ed25519 and 114 bytes (57 + 57 bytes) for Ed448. It holds a compressed point R + the integer s (confirming that the signer knows the msg and the privKey).\nEdDSA Verify Signature\nThe EdDSA signature verification algorithm (RFC 8032) takes as input a text message msg + the signer's EdDSA public key pubKey + the EdDSA signature {R, s} and produces as output a boolean value (valid or invalid signature). EdDSA verification works as follows (with minor simplifications):\nEdDSA_signature_verify(msg, pubKey, signature { R, s } ) --> valid / invalid\n\nCalculate h = hash(R + pubKey + msg) mod q\nCalculate P1 = s * G\nCalculate P2 = R + h * pubKey\nReturn P1 == P2\n\nHow Does it Work? \nDuring the verification the point P1 is calculated as: P1 = s * G.\nDuring the signing s = (r + h * privKey) mod q. Now replace s in the above equation:\n\nP1 = s * G = (r + h * privKey) mod q * G = r * G + h * privKey * G = R + h * pubKey\n\nThe above is exactly the other point P2. If these points P1 and P2 are the same EC point, this proves that the point P1, calculated by the private key matches the point P2, created by its corresponding public key.\nECDSA vs EdDSA\nIf we compare the signing and verification for EdDSA, we shall find that EdDSA is simpler than ECDSA, easier to understand and to implement. Both signature algorithms have similar security strength for curves with similar key lengths. For the most popular curves (liked edwards25519 and edwards448) the EdDSA algorithm is slightly faster than ECDSA, but this highly depends on the curves used and on the certain implementation. Unlike ECDSA the EdDSA signatures do not provide a way to recover the signer's public key from the signature and the message. Generally, it is considered that EdDSA is recommended for most modern apps.\n"},"digital-signatures/eddsa-sign-verify-examples.html":{"url":"digital-signatures/eddsa-sign-verify-examples.html","title":"EdDSA: Sign / Verify - Examples","keywords":"","body":"EdDSA: Sign / Verify - Examples\nAfter we explained in the previous section how the EdDSA signatures work, now it is time to demonstrate them with code examples.

The EdDSA-Ed25519 signature {R, s} is 32 + 32 bytes (64 bytes, 128 hex digits).\nIf we try to verify a tampered message, the verification will fail:\ntry:\n    pubKey.verify(signature, \"Tampered msg\", encoding='hex')\n    print(\"The signature is valid.\")\nexcept:\n    print(\"Invalid signature!\")\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/Ed25519-verify-tampered-message-in-Python.\nThe output from the above sample code is as expected:\nInvalid signature!\nEd448 Signatures - Example\nNow, let's demonstrate how to use the Ed448 signature (EdDSA over the Curve448-Goldilocks curve in Edwards form).\nWe shall use the Python elliptic curve library ECPy, which implements ECC with Weierstrass curves (like secp256k1 and NIST P-256), Montgomery curves (like Curve25519 and Curve448) and twisted Edwards curves (like Ed25519 and Ed448):\npip install ecpy\n\nNext, generate a private + public key pair for the Ed448 cryptosystem:\nfrom ecpy.curves import Curve\nfrom ecpy.keys import ECPrivateKey\nfrom ecpy.eddsa import EDDSA\nimport secrets, hashlib, binascii\n\ncurve = Curve.get_curve('Ed448')\nsigner = EDDSA(hashlib.shake_256, hash_len=114)\nprivKey = ECPrivateKey(secrets.randbits(57*8), curve)\npubKey = signer.get_public_key(privKey, hashlib.shake_256, hash_len=114)\nprint(\"Private key (57 bytes):\", privKey)\nprint(\"Public key (compressed, 57 bytes): \",\n      binascii.hexlify(curve.encode_point(pubKey.W)))\nprint(\"Public key (point): \", pubKey)\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/Ed448-private-public-keys-in-Python.\nThe Ed448 key pair is generated randomly.

The EdDSA-Ed448 signature {R, s} consists of 57 + 57 bytes (114 bytes, 228 hex digits).\nNext, sign a sample message using the private key, and verify the signature using the public key after that:\nmsg = b'Message for Ed448 signing'\nsignature = signer.sign(msg, privKey)\nprint(\"Signature (114 bytes):\", binascii.hexlify(signature))\n\nvalid = signer.verify(msg, signature, pubKey)\nprint(\"Valid signature?\", valid)\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/Ed448-sign-verify-in-Python.\nThe output from the above code example (for the above Ed448 key pair) is:\nSignature (114 bytes): b'5114674f1ce8a2615f2b15138944e5c58511804d72a96260ce8c587e7220daa90b9e65b450ff49563744d7633b43a78b8dc6ec3e3397b50080a15f06ce8005ad817a1681a4e96ee6b4831679ef448d7c283b188ed64d399d6bac420fadf33964b2f2e0f2d1abd401e8eb09ab29e3ff280600'\nValid signature?

Quantum computers are not \"faster computers\" and they are not all-powerful and cannot do any computing job faster. Quantum computers are very efficient for certain problems and quite weak for others.\nIt is well known in computer science that quantum computers will break some cryptographic algorithms, especially the public-key cryptosystems like RSA, ECC and ECDSA that rely on the IFP (integer factorization problem), the DLP (discrete logarithms problem) and the ECDLP (elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem).

Example","keywords":"","body":"Quantum-Safe Signatures - Example\nIn this example, we shall demonstrate the ****SPHINCS+ signature library. It implements hash-based signatures, which are designed to be quantum-safe. Note that the SPHINCS+ signatures are still experimental (as of Nov 2018) and their security is not still indisputably proven, because they are relatively new and are still not well analysed by cryptographers.\nWe shall demonstrate the SPHINCS+ cryptosystem for hash-based digital signatures, more precisely two of its configurations:\n\nSPHINCS+-128f – 64-byte private key, 32-byte public key, ~16.9KB signature, instant key generation, fast signing speed \nSPHINCS+-128s – 64-byte private key, 32-byte public key, ~ 8KB signature, instant key generation, slow signing speed ~ few secs, instant verification, 133-bit security level\n\nTo install the official SPHINCS+ signature library PySPX for Python, use the following command:\npip install pyspx\n\nThe pyspx package may not compile in Windows (using the Visual C++ compiler), so Linux is recommended (or a Python virtual machine like PythonAnywhere or Repl.it).\nLet's demonstrate the SPHINCS+ signature with the shake256_128f parameter set (SPHINCS+, using SHAKE256-128 as hash function and in fast mode), using this Python example:\nimport pyspx.shake256_128f as sphincs\nimport os, binascii\n\n# Key generation: private + public key\nseed = os.urandom(sphincs.crypto_sign_SEEDBYTES)\npublic_key, secret_key = sphincs.generate_keypair(seed)\nprint(\"Public key:\", binascii.hexlify(public_key))\nprint(\"Private key:\", binascii.hexlify(secret_key))\n\n# Sign message and verify signature\nmessage = b'Message for SPHINCS+ shake256_128f signing'\nsignature = sphincs.sign(message, secret_key)\nvalid = sphincs.verify(message, signature, public_key)\nprint(\"Message:\", message)\nprint(\"Signature:\", binascii.hexlify(signature))\nprint(\"Signature valid?\", valid)\n\n# Verify tampered message + signature\nmessage = b'Tampered msg'\nvalid = sphincs.verify(message, signature, public_key)\nprint(\"Tampered message:\", message)\nprint(\"Tampered signature valid?\", valid)\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/SPHINCSplus-signature-in-Python.\nThe above code is fast: it runs for portion of the second. The output from it looks like this:\nPublic key: b'73004fe93b401a2ab9e0f3ccebbb9d8fe38b0080033eb80a9ecd8028451bbbcb'\nPrivate key: b'e2e5f5f4574cc2774ee4b30c21f4067321a619d54dd92e539b6adcf6f932c6c573004fe93b401a2ab9e0f3ccebbb9d8fe38b0080033eb80a9ecd8028451bbbcb'\nMessage: b'Message for SPHINCS+ shake256_128f signing'\nSignature: b'fbdb1d37371b7f18fb8b1cb2ae452f2aea3c17b4b5c2cee564ee6617915ba3aa813c1eb418e8b2e191b6d15bbcbf47bea4682d1a842dc8b8f589c8108bdea153506e1ee245530b2ad3cec6a6955bc691c8b4aa777...cc276446ea6'\nSignature valid? True\nTampered message: b'Tampered msg'\nTampered signature valid? False\nIt is visible from the above output that for the shake256_128f parameter set the SPHINCS+ public key is small (32 bytes), the private key is also small (64 bytes), but the signature is big (16976 bytes, ~16.9 KB, partially shown above). This makes SPHINCS+ signatures not an ideal solution for the post-quantum signatures. Additionally, the signature computation speed is sensibly slower than RSA and ECDSA.\nLet's tweak the SPHINCS+ algorithm parameters to get shorter signature, using the shake256_128s parameter set (SPHINCS+, using SHAKE256-128 as hash function and in slow mode). This smaller signature will cost many times more computing time for signing. Let's change the algorithm parameters like this (in fact the important change is at the first line only):\nimport pyspx.shake256_128s as sphincs\nimport os, binascii\n\n# Key generation: private + public key\nseed = os.urandom(sphincs.crypto_sign_SEEDBYTES)\npublic_key, secret_key = sphincs.generate_keypair(seed)\nprint(\"Public key:\", binascii.hexlify(public_key))\nprint(\"Private key:\", binascii.hexlify(secret_key))\n\n# Sign message and verify signature\nmessage = b'Message for SPHINCS+ shake256_128s signing'\nsignature = sphincs.sign(message, secret_key)\nvalid = sphincs.verify(message, signature, public_key)\nprint(\"Message:\", message)\nprint(\"Signature:\", binascii.hexlify(signature))\nprint(\"Signature valid?\", valid)\n\n# Verify tampered message + signature\nmessage = b'Tampered msg'\nvalid = sphincs.verify(message, signature, public_key)\nprint(\"Tampered message:\", message)\nprint(\"Tampered signature valid?\", valid)\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/SPHINCSplus-signature-smaller-size-in-Python.\nThe produced signature size now is smaller (~ 8KB, partially shown below), but the time to generate the signature is drastically increased (signing takes a few seconds, key generation and signature verification are still fast):\nPublic key: b'd2ac35f1a6124b4a45d196b3fa9292b9bb3245f8c0dbdb586ea5879eb22487f0'\nPrivate key: b'8dc8e4cf3dc6fd28cb14a46fa2350dd41acdfb351c49e8caea86ca95ee2184ddd2ac35f1a6124b4a45d196b3fa9292b9bb3245f8c0dbdb586ea5879eb22487f0'\nMessage: b'Message for SPHINCS+ shake256_128s signing'\nSignature: b'a92bbecfae693e3fdc15fa0f5d9f4a941a7ae98822be6ca0d194db3930e45fe5cb429b29757f4539dcb444652224d3ab0d0fca2c792b7acf597b632880bf9a6feb0dc444491a9e9ef902...0abeb7a42cb262'\nSignature valid? True\nTampered message: b'Tampered msg'\nTampered signature valid? False\nWe may conclude that quantum-safe digital signature algorithms like SPHINCS+ signatures may replace ECDSA and EdDSA in the post-quantum computing era, but they still have one big disadvantage: large signatures. For some applications the signature size may not be a problem, but for others smaller signatures are critical.\n"},"quantum-safe-cryptography/quantum-safe-key-exchange-example.html":{"url":"quantum-safe-cryptography/quantum-safe-key-exchange-example.html","title":"Quantum-Safe Key Exchange - Example","keywords":"","body":"Quantum-Safe Key Exchange - Example\nIn this example we shall demonstrate the how to use the NewHope key exchange protocol, which is a quantum-safe lattice-based key-exchange algorithm, designed to provide at least 128-bit post-quantum security level. The underlying math is based on the Ring-Learning-with-Errors (Ring-LWE) problem and operates in a ring of integer polynomials by certain modulo. The key-exchange operates like this:\n\nAlice generates a random private key and corresponding public message (public key) and sends the message to Bob. The public message consists of 1024 polynomial coefficients (integers in the range [0...61443]) + random seed (32 bytes).\nBob takes the message from Alice (polynomial + seed) and calculates from it the shared secret key between Alice and Bob. Bob also generates internally a private key and uses it to calculate and sends a public message to Alice. This public message consists of 2 polynomials, each represented by 1024 integer coefficients.\nAlice takes the message from Bob (the 2 polynomials) and calculates from it the shared secret key between Alice and Bob (using her private key). The calculated shared key consists of 32 bytes (256 bits), perfect for symmetric key encryption.\n\nTo illustrate the NewHope key exchange algorithm, we shall use the PyNewHope package from the Python's official PyPI repository (which is designed for educational purposes and is not certified for production use):\npip install pynewhope\n\nThe code to demonstrate the quantum-safe key-exchange \"NewHope\" is simple:\nfrom pynewhope import newhope\n\n# Step 1: Alice generates random keys and her public msg to Bob\nalicePrivKey, aliceMsg = newhope.keygen()\nprint(\"Alice sends to Bob her public message:\", aliceMsg)\n\n# Step 2: Bob receives the msg from Alice and responds to Alice with a msg\nbobSharedKey, bobMsg = newhope.sharedB(aliceMsg)\nprint(\"\\nBob's sends to Alice his public message:\", bobMsg)\nprint(\"\\nBob's shared key:\", bobSharedKey)\n\n# Step 3: Alice receives the msg from Bob and generates her shared secret\naliceSharedKey = newhope.sharedA(bobMsg, alicePrivKey)\nprint(\"\\nAlice's shared key:\", aliceSharedKey)\n\nif aliceSharedKey == bobSharedKey:\n    print(\"\\nSuccessful key exchange!

The set of algorithms that cipher suites usually contain include: a key exchange algorithm, a symmetric encryption algorithm, and a message authentication code (MAC) algorithm.\nExternal Authentication and OAuth\n...\nTwo-Factor Authentication and One-Time Passwords\nMulti-Factor authentication adds additional layers of identity authentication. Usually, those factors should be added to some of the following categories:\n\nWhat I know\nWhat I have\nWhat I am\n\nTwo-Factor Authentication requires two of those three categories to be implemented. The most common case of Two-Factor Authentication is a user password and a device on which will be sent/generate one-time-password. To generate a one-time-password (OTP) the HMAC-based One-time Password algorithm is used.\nHMAC-based One-time Password (HOTP)\nThe HOTP algorithm is based on HMAC and provides a symmetric generation of human-readable passwords, each used for only one authentication attempt. The key parameter of HTOP is a secret which has to be exchanged between the parties in advance:\nHTOP(has_function, secret, value_length) -> htop\nhtop.generate() -> auth_code\nhtop.validate(auth_code) -> true/false\nThe hash_func can be any cryptographic hash function. The secret is the arbitrary byte string which must be shared between the parties and kept private. value_length defines the auth_code length.\nCounter-based One-Time Password algorithm (COTP)\nIn the COTP scenario the HTOP function contains an internal counter. In order for parties to successfully authenticate each other they have to keep their counters in sync. Each time HOTP is requested to generate an auth_code the counter increments.\nTime-based One-Time Password Algorithm (TOTP)\nTime-based One-Time Password Algorithm (TOTP) is an extension of COTP, where the counter is the current time, defined as Unix time. The time-interval is another parameter used for the generation of TOTP, which defines a period of time of which a given authentication code will be valid.\nhtop_counter = (current_time - initial_time) / time_interval\nFor TOTP to work correctly both parties need to have synchronized clocks with minimal verification time-step window (delay based on user's input, network latency, and clock time deviation).\notp = TOTP(hash_function(secret), htop_counter)\nTime-based One-Time Password in Practice\nA popular use case of Two-Factor Authentication is the Google Authenticator. A server generates a secret and shares it as a QR code with the client. The client scan and store the secret in the Google Authenticator application on a phone. After that, the server and the phone start to generate the same one-time passwords.\nAn example of a web-based JavaScript example for using and testing TOTP:\n\nInfected Cryptosystems and Crypto Backdoors\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleptography\nOther Cryptographic Concepts and Standards\nJust to mention, the practical cryptography is endless.

Example of 256-bit ECC private key (hex encoded, 32 bytes, 64 hex digits) is: 0x51897b64e85c3f714bba707e867914295a1377a7463a9dae8ea6a8b914246319.\nThe key generation in the ECC cryptography is as simple as securely generating a random integer in certain range, so it is extremely fast. Any number within the range is valid ECC private key.\nThe public keys in the ECC are EC points - pairs of integer coordinates {x, y}, laying on the curve. Due to their special properties, EC points can be compressed to just one coordinate + 1 bit (odd or even). Thus the compressed public key, corresponding to a 256-bit ECC private key, is a 257-bit integer. Example of ECC public key (corresponding to the above private key, encoded in the Ethereum format, as hex with prefix 02 or 03) is: 0x02f54ba86dc1ccb5bed0224d23f01ed87e4a443c47fc690d7797a13d41d2340e1a. In this format the public key actually takes 33 bytes (66 hex digits), which can be optimized to exactly 257 bits.\nCurves and Key Length\nECC crypto algorithms can use different underlying elliptic curves. Different curves provide different level of security (cryptographic strength), different performance (speed) and different key length, and also may involve different algorithms.\nECC curves, adopted in the popular cryptographic libraries and security standards, have name (named curves, e.g. secp256k1 or Curve25519), field size (which defines the key length, e.g. 256-bit), security strength (usually the field size / 2 or less), performance (operations/sec) and many other parameters.\nECC keys have length, which directly depends on the underlying curve. In most applications (like OpenSSL, OpenSSH and Bitcoin) the default key length for the ECC private keys is 256 bits, but depending on the curve many different ECC key sizes are possible: 192-bit (curve secp192r1), 233-bit (curve sect233k1), 224-bit (curve secp224k1), 256-bit (curves secp256k1 and Curve25519), 283-bit (curve sect283k1), 384-bit (curves p384 and secp384r1), 409-bit (curve sect409r1), 414-bit (curve Curve41417), 448-bit (curve Curve448-Goldilocks), 511-bit (curve M-511), 521-bit (curve P-521), 571-bit (curve sect571k1) and many others.\nECC Algorithms\nElliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) provides several groups of algorithms, based on the math of the elliptic curves over finite fields:\n\nECC digital signature algorithms like ECDSA (for classical curves) and EdDSA (for twisted Edwards curves).\nECC encryption algorithms and hybrid encryption schemes like the ECIES integrated encryption scheme and EEECC (EC-based ElGamal).\nECC key agreement algorithms like ECDH, X25519 and FHMQV.\n\nAll these algorithms use a curve behind (like secp256k1, curve25519 or p521) for the calculations and rely of the difficulty of the ECDLP (elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem). All these algorithms use public / private key pairs, where the private key is an integer and the public key is a point on the elliptic curve (EC point). Let's get into details about the elliptic curves over finite fields.\nElliptic Curves\nIn mathematics elliptic curves are plane algebraic curves, consisting of all points {x, y}, described by the equation:\n\nCryptography uses elliptic curves in a simplified form (Weierstras form), which is defined as:\n\ny2 = x3 + _a_x + b\n\nFor example, the NIST curve secp256k1 (used in Bitcoin) is based on an elliptic curve in the form:\n\ny2 = x3 + 7 (the above elliptic curve equation, where a = 0 and b = 7)\n\nThis is a visualization of the above elliptic curve:\n\nTo learn more about the equations of the elliptic curves and how they look like, play a bit with this online elliptic curve visualization tool: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ialhd71we3.\n\nElliptic Curves over Finite Fields\nThe elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) uses elliptic curves over the finite field 𝔽p (where p is prime and p > 3) or 𝔽2m (where the fields size p = 2_m_). This means that the field is a square matrix of size p x p and the points on the curve are limited to integer coordinates within the field only. All algebraic operations within the field (like point addition and multiplication) result in another point within the field. The elliptic curve equation over the finite field 𝔽p takes the following modular form:\n\ny2 ≡ x3 + _a_x + b (mod p)\n\nRespectively, the \"Bitcoin curve\" secp256k1 takes the form:\n\ny2 ≡ x3 + 7 (mod p)\n\nUnlike RSA, which uses for its key space the integers in the range [0...p-1] (the field ℤp), the ECC uses the points {x, y} within the Galois field 𝔽p (where x and y are integers in the range [0...p-1]).\nAn elliptic curve over the finite field 𝔽p consists of:\n\na set of integer coordinates {x, y}, such that 0 ≤ x, y p\nstaying on the elliptic curve: _y_2 ≡ x3 + _a_x + b (mod p)\n\nExample of elliptic curve over the finite field 𝔽17:\n\ny2 ≡ x3 + 7 (mod 17)\n\nThis elliptic curve over 𝔽17 looks like this:\n\nNote that the elliptic curve over finite field y2 ≡ x3 + 7 (mod 17) consists of the blue points at the above figure, i.e. in practice the \"elliptic curves\" used in cryptography are \"sets of points in square matrix\", not classical \"curves\".\nThe above curve is \"educational\". It provides very small key length (4-5 bits). In the real world developers typically use curves of 256-bits or more.\nElliptic Curves over Finite Fields: Calculations\nIt is pretty easy to calculate whether certain point belongs to certain elliptic curve over a finite field. For example, a point {x, y} belongs to the curve y2 ≡ x3 + 7 (mod 17) when and only when:\n\nx3 + 7 - y2 ≡ 0 (mod 17)\n\nThe point P {5, 8} belongs to the curve, because (5**3 + 7 - 8**2) % 17 == 0. The point {9, 15} does not belong to the curve, because (9**3 + 7 - 15**2) % 17 != 0. These calculations are in Python style. The above mentioned elliptic curve and the points {5, 8} and {9, 15} are visualized below:\n\nMultiplying ECC Point by Integer\nTwo points over an elliptic curve (EC points) can be added and the result is another point. This operation is known as EC point addition. If we add a point G to itself, the result is G + G = 2 * G. If we add G again to the result, we will obtain 3 * G and so on. This is how EC point multiplication is defined.\nA point G over an elliptic curve over finite field (EC point) can be multiplied by an integer k and the result is another EC point P on the same curve and this operation is fast:\n\nP = k * G\n\nThe above operation involves some formulas and transformations, but for simplicity, we shall skip them. The important thing to know is that multiplying EC point by integer returns another EC point on the same curve and this operation is fast. Multiplying an EC point by 0 returns a special EC point called \"infinity\".\nEveryone is free to read more about EC point multiplication in Wikipedia.\nExample: Multiply EC Point by Integer\nThe formulas for EC multiplication differ for the different forms of representation of the curve. In this example, we shall use an elliptic curve in the classical Weierstrass form.\nFor example let's take the EC point G = {15, 13} on the elliptic curve over finite field y2 ≡ x3 + 7 (mod 17) and multiply it by k = 6. We shall obtain an EC point P = {5, 8}:\n\nP = k * G = 6 * {15, 13} = {5, 8}\n\nThe below figure visualizes this example of EC point multiplication:\n\nOrder and Cofactor of Elliptic Curve\nАn elliptic curve over a finite field can form a finite cyclic algebraic group, which consists of all the points on the curve. In a cyclic group, if two EC points are added or an EC point is multiplied to an integer, the result is another EC point from the same cyclic group (and on the same curve). The order of the curve is the total number of all EC points on the curve. This total number of points includes also the special point called \"point at infinity\", which is obtained when a point is multiplied by 0.\nSome curves form a single cyclic group (holding all their EC points), while others form several non-overlapping cyclic subgroups (each holding a subset of the curve's EC points). In the second scenario the points on the curve are split into h cyclic subgroups (partitions), each of order r (each subgroup holds equal number of points). The order of entire group is n = h * r (the number of subgroups, multiplied by the number of points in each subgroup). The number of subgroups h holding the EC points is called cofactor.\n\nThe cofactor is typically expressed by the following formula:\n\nh = n / r\n\nwhere\n\nn is the order of the curve (the number of all its points)\nh is the curve cofactor (the number of non-overlapping subgroups of points, which together hold all curve points)\nr is the order of the subgroups (the number of points in each subgroup, including the infinity point for each subgroup)\n\nIn other words, the points over an elliptic curve stay in one or several non-overlapping subsets, called cyclic subgroups. The number of subgroups is called \"cofactor\". The total number of points in all subgroups is called \"order\" of the curve and is usually denoted by n. If the curve consists of only one cyclic subgroup, its cofactor h = 1. If the curve consists of several subgroups, its cofactor > 1.\n\nExample of elliptic curve having cofactor = 1 is secp256k1.\nExample of elliptic curve having cofactor = 8 is Curve25519.\nExample of elliptic curve having cofactor = 4 is Curve448.\n\nThe \"Generator\" Point in ECC\nFor the elliptic curves over finite fields, the ECC cryptosystems define a special pre-defined (constant) EC point called generator point G (base point), which can generate any other point in its subgroup over the elliptic curve by multiplying G by some integer in the range [0...r]. The number r is called \"order\" of the cyclic subgroup (the total number of all points in the subgroup).\nFor curves with cofactor = 1 there is only one subgroup and the order n of the curve (the total number of different points over the curve, including the infinity) is equal to the number r.\nWhen G and n are carefully selected, and the cofactor = 1, all possible EC points on the curve (including the special point infinity) can be generated from the generator G by multiplying it by integer in the range [1...n]. This integer n is known as \"order of the curve\".\nIt is important to know that the order r of the subgroup, obtained from certain EC generator point G (which may be different from the order of the curve) defines the total number of all possible private keys for this curve: r = n / h (curve order, divided by the curve cofactor). Cryptographers select carefully the elliptic curve domain parameters (curve equation, generator point, cofactor, etc.) to ensure that the key space is large enough for certain cryptographic strength.\nTo summarize, in the ECC cryptography the EC points, together with the generator point G form cyclic groups (or cyclic subgroups), which means that a number r exists (r > 1), such that r * G = 0 * G = infinity and all points in the subgroup can be obtained by multiplying G by integer in the range [1...r]. The number r is called order of the group (or subgroup).\nElliptic curve subgroups usually have many generator points, but cryptographers carefully select one of them, which generates the entire group (or subgroup) and is suitable for performance optimizations in the computations. This is the generator known as \"G\".\nIt is known that for some curves different generator points generate subgroups of different order. More precisely, if the group order is n, for each prime d dividing n, there is a point Q such that d * Q = infinity. This means that some points used as generators for the same curve will generate smaller subgroups than others. if the group is small, the security is weak. This is known as \"small-subgroup\" attacks. This is the reason why cryptographers usually choose the subgroup order r to be a prime number.\nFor elliptic curves with cofactor h > 1, different base points can generate different subgroups of EC points on the curve. By choosing a certain generator point, we choose to operate over a certain subgroup of points on the curve and most EC point operations and ECC crypto algorithms will work well. Still in some cases, special attention should be given, so it is recommended to use only proven ECC implementations, algorithms and software packages.\nGenerator Point - Example\nAt the above example (the EC over finite field y2 ≡ x3 + 7 mod 17), if we take the point G = {15, 13} as generator, any other point from the curve can be obtained by multiplying G by some integer in the range [1...18]. Thus the order of this EC is n = 18 and its cofactor h = 1.\nNote that the curve has 17 normal EC points (shown at the above figures) + one special \"point at infinity\", all staying in a single subgroup, and the curve order is 18 (not 17).\nNote also, that if we take the point {5, 9} as generator, it will generate just 3 EC points: {5, 8}, {5, 9} and infinity. Because the curve order is not prime number, different generators may generate subgroups of different order. This is a good example why we should not \"invent\" our own elliptic curves for cryptographic purposes and we should use proven curves.\nPrivate Key, Public Key and the Generator Point in ECC\nIn the ECC, when we multiply a fixed EC point G (the generator point) by certain integer k (k can be considered as private key), we obtain an EC point P (its corresponding public key).\nConsequently, in ECC we have:\n\nЕlliptic curve (EC) over finite field 𝔽p\nG == generator point (fixed constant, a base point on the EC)\nk == private key (integer)\nP == public key (point)\n\nIt is very fast to calculate P = k * G, using the well-known ECC multiplication algorithms in time log_2(k_), e.g. the \"double-and-add algorithm\". For 256-bit curves, it will take just a few hundreds simple EC operations.\nIt is extremely slow (considered infeasible for large k) to calculate k = P / G.\nThis asymmetry (fast multiplication and infeasible slow opposite operation) is the basis of the security strength behind the ECC cryptography, also known as the ECDLP problem.\nElliptic-Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP)\nThe Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP) in computer science is defined as follows:\n\nBy given elliptic curve over finite field 𝔽p and generator point G on the curve and point P on the curve, find the integer k (if it exists), such that P = k * G\n\nFor carefully chosen (by cryptographers) finite fields and elliptic curves, the ECDLP problem has no efficient solution.\nThe multiplication of elliptic curve points in the group 𝔽p is similar to exponentiation of integers in the group ℤp (this is known as multiplicative notation) and this is how the ECDLP problem is similar to the DLP problem (discrete logarithm problem).\nIn the ECC cryptography, many algorithms rely on the computational difficulty of the ECDLP problem over carefully chosen field 𝔽p and elliptic curve, for which no efficient algorithm exists.\nECC and Curve Security Strength\nBecause the fastest known algorithm to solve the ECDLP for key of size k needs k\\sqrt{k}√​k​​​ steps, this means that to achieve a k-bit security strength, at least 2*k-bit curve is needed. Thus 256-bit elliptic curves (where the field size p is 256-bit number) typically provide nearly 128-bit security strength.\nIn fact, the strength is slightly less, because the order of the curve (n) is typically less than the fields size (p) and because the curve may have cofactor h > 1 (and subgroup order r = n / h, smaller than n) and because the number of steps is not exactly k\\sqrt{k}√​k​​​, but is 0.886∗k0.886 * \\sqrt{k}0.886∗√​k​​​. A precise security strength estimation for the most popular standard elliptic curves is given here: http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/rho.html.\nFor example, the secp256k1 (p = 256) curve provides ~ 128-bit security (127.8 bits to be precise) and the Curve448 (p = 448) provides ~ 224-bit security (222.8 bits to be precise).\nMultiplication of EC Points - Example in Python\nNow, after all the concepts, let's write some code. We shall use the Python library tinyec, which provides ECC primitives, such as cyclic groups (the SubGroup class), elliptic curves over finite fields (the Curve class) and EC points (the Point class). First, install the package tinyec:\npip install tinyec\n\nWe shall play with the educational curve from our previous examples y2 ≡ x3 + 7 (mod 17), with the generator point G = {15, 13}, which has order of n = 18. We shall name it p1707.\nfrom tinyec.ec import SubGroup, Curve\n\nfield = SubGroup(p=17, g=(15, 13), n=18, h=1)\ncurve = Curve(a=0, b=7, field=field, name='p1707')\nprint('curve:', curve)\n\nfor k in range(0, 25):\n    p = k * curve.g\n    print(f\"{k} * G = ({p.x}, {p.y})\")\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/EC-points-in-Python. The above code demonstrates the EC multiplication. It multiplies the generator point G by 0, 1, 2, ..., 24. The output from the above program is as follows:\ncurve: \"p1707\" => y^2 = x^3 + 0x + 7 (mod 17)\n0 * G = (None, None)\n1 * G = (15, 13)\n2 * G = (2, 10)\n3 * G = (8, 3)\n4 * G = (12, 1)\n5 * G = (6, 6)\n6 * G = (5, 8)\n7 * G = (10, 15)\n8 * G = (1, 12)\n9 * G = (3, 0)\n10 * G = (1, 5)\n11 * G = (10, 2)\n12 * G = (5, 9)\n13 * G = (6, 11)\n14 * G = (12, 16)\n15 * G = (8, 14)\n16 * G = (2, 7)\n17 * G = (15, 4)\n18 * G = (None, None)\n19 * G = (15, 13)\n20 * G = (2, 10)\n21 * G = (8, 3)\n22 * G = (12, 1)\n23 * G = (6, 6)\n24 * G = (5, 8)\nIt is visible that 0 * G = infinity. It is also clearly visible, that the EC group is cyclic and the order of the EC group is n = 18, because starting from k = 18, the next points repeat the first ones:\n\n18 * G = 0 * G = infinity\n19 * G = 1 * G = {15, 13}\n20 * G = 2 * G = {2, 10}\n21 * G = 3 * G = {8, 3}\netc.\n\nThe EC points, generated by multiplying the generator point G by 2, 3, 4, ..., 17 are shown on the figure below:\n\nLet's modify a bit the above example and change the generator point to be G' = {5, 9}. This will change significantly the output:\nfrom tinyec.ec import SubGroup, Curve\n\nfield = SubGroup(p=17, g=(5, 9), n=18, h=1)\ncurve = Curve(a=0, b=7, field=field, name='p1707')\nprint('curve:', curve)\n\nfor k in range(0, 25):\n    p = k * curve.g\n    print(f\"{k} * G' = ({p.x}, {p.y})\")\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/EC-points-by-generator-point-in-Python. The output shows that the subgroup order of the new generator point is not 18, but is 3. This is possible, because 18 is not prime. It is clear from the output, that 3 * G' = infinity and the obtained subgroup order is 3:\ncurve: \"p1707\" => y^2 = x^3 + 0x + 7 (mod 17)\n0 * G' = (None, None)\n1 * G' = (5, 9)\n2 * G' = (5, 8)\n3 * G' = (None, None)\n4 * G' = (5, 9)\n5 * G' = (5, 8)\n6 * G' = (None, None)\n...\nThe above example again confirms that designing an elliptic curve for cryptography should be done by cryptographers, not by developers. Developers should rely on well established crypto-standards and proven crypto-libraries.\nMultiplication of EC Points - Real-World Example in Python\nNow, let's write a real-world example. Instead of using our educational curve p1707 (4-5-bit curve, p = 17), we shall use the 192-bit cryptographic curve secp192r1 (192-bit, p = 6277101735386680763835789423207666416083908700390324961279). The below example is similar to the previous:\nfrom tinyec import registry\n\ncurve = registry.get_curve('secp192r1')\nprint('curve:', curve)\n\nfor k in range(0, 10):\n    p = k * curve.g\n    print(f\"{k} * G = ({p.x}, {p.y})\")\n\nprint(\"Cofactor =\", curve.field.h)\n\nprint('Cyclic group order =', curve.field.n)\n\nnG = curve.field.n * curve.g\nprint(f\"n * G = ({nG.x}, {nG.y})\")\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/EC-points-in-real-world-in-Python. The output is also similar to the previous example:\ncurve: \"secp192r1\" => y^2 = x^3 + 6277101735386680763835789423207666416083908700390324961276x + 2455155546008943817740293915197451784769108058161191238065 (mod 6277101735386680763835789423207666416083908700390324961279)\n0 * G = (None, None)\n1 * G = (602046282375688656758213480587526111916698976636884684818, 174050332293622031404857552280219410364023488927386650641)\n2 * G = (5369744403678710563432458361254544170966096384586764429448, 5429234379789071039750654906915254128254326554272718558123)\n3 * G = (2915109630280678890720206779706963455590627465886103135194, 2946626711558792003980654088990112021985937607003425539581)\n4 * G = (1305994880430903997305943738697779408316929565234787837114, 3981863977451150342116987835776121688410789618551673306674)\n5 * G = (410283251116784874018993562136566870110676706936762660240, 1206654674899825246688205669651974202006189255452737318561)\n6 * G = (4008504146453526025173196900303594155799995627910231899946, 3263759301305176906990806636587838100022690095020155627760)\n7 * G = (3473339081378406123852871299395262476289672479707038350589, 2152713176906603604200842901176476029776544337891569565621)\n8 * G = (1167950611014894512313033362696697441497340081390841490910, 4002177906111215127148483369584652296488769677804145538752)\n9 * G = (3176317450453705650283775811228493626776489433309636475023, 44601893774669384766793803854980115179612118075017062201)\nCofactor = 1\nCyclic group order = 6277101735386680763835789423176059013767194773182842284081\nn * G = (None, None)\nThe curve secp192r1 uses a cyclic group of very large order n = 6277101735386680763835789423176059013767194773182842284081 (prime number) with cofactor h = 1, and as we can expect, n * G = infinity, just like at the previous example with our educational curve.\nNow, let's generate a random private key privKey (integer in the range [0...n-1]) and its corresponding public key pubKey = privKey * G:\nfrom tinyec import registry\nimport secrets\n\ncurve = registry.get_curve('secp192r1')\n\nprivKey = secrets.randbelow(curve.field.n)\npubKey = privKey * curve.g\nprint(\"private key:\", privKey)\nprint(\"public key:\", pubKey)\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/EC-points-private-public-keys-in-Python. The above code will produce output like this:\nprivate key: 4225655318977962031264230130242180748818603147467615868902\npublic key: (5396030834456770190396776530938374882273836179487834152291, 3422160588166914010077732710830109086004758012634997793937) on \"secp192r1\" => y^2 = x^3 + 6277101735386680763835789423207666416083908700390324961276x + 2455155546008943817740293915197451784769108058161191238065 (mod 6277101735386680763835789423207666416083908700390324961279)\nLater we shall use such pairs of ECC keys {private key, public key} to encrypt data, sign messages and verify signatures.\nNote that in real projects, 192-bit curves are considered weak, so 256-bit curves are recommended (or more bits), where the keys are also 256-bits (or respectively more). We use 192-bit curve in the above example just to make the sample output smaller.\nPublic Key Compression in the Elliptic Key Cryptosystems\nElliptic curves over finite fields 𝔽p (in the Weierstrass form) have at most 2 points per y coordinate (odd x and even x). This property comes from the nature of the elliptic curve equation and is illustrated at the below graph:\n\nDue to this property, an elliptic curve point (and respectively an ECC public key) P {x, y} can be compressed as C {x, odd/even). This means to erase the y coordinate from the point and represent it as 1 bit (odd y or even y).\nCompressed EC point is an EC point {x, y} represented in its shorter form {x, odd / even}. ECC public keys are EC points, so they can also be compressed in the same way.\nTo decompress a point, we can calculate its two possible y coordinates by the formulas:\n\ny1 = mod_sqrt(x3 + ax + b, p)\ny2 = p - mod_sqrt(x3 + ax + b, p)\n\nThen we take the odd or even from the above coordinates (according to the additional parity bit in the compressed representation).\nThe modular square root (mod_sqrt) can be calculated using the Tonelli–Shanks algorithm.\nLet's take an example: at the elliptic curve y2 ≡ x3 + 7 (mod 17) the point P {10, 15} can be compressed as C {10, odd}. For decompression, we first calculate the two possible y coordinates for x = 10 using the above formulas: y1 = 2 and y2 = 15. Then we choose the odd one: y = 15. The decompressed point is {10, 15}.\nCompressing a EC Point / Public Key - Example in Python\nThe code below implements public key compression and decompression in Python. It uses a library called nummaster for the \"modular square root\" function, which is unavailable in Python. First install the nummaster package:\npip install nummaster\n\nNow implement the EC point compression and decompression functions in Python:\nfrom nummaster.basic import sqrtmod\n\ndef compress_point(point):\n    return (point[0], point[1] % 2)\n\ndef uncompress_point(compressed_point, p, a, b):\n    x, is_odd = compressed_point\n    y = sqrtmod(pow(x, 3, p) + a * x + b, p)\n    if bool(is_odd) == bool(y & 1):\n        return (x, y)\n    return (x, p - y)\n\nFinally, compress and decompress the point {10, 15} on the curve y2 ≡ x3 + 7 (mod 17), just as an example:\np, a, b = 17, 0, 7\npoint = (10, 15)\nprint(f\"original point = {point}\")\ncompressed_p = compress_point(point)\nprint(f\"compressed = {compressed_p}\")\nrestored_p = uncompress_point(compressed_p, p, a, b)\nprint(f\"uncompressed = {restored_p}\")\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/EC-point-compression-decompression-in-Python. The output of the above code is:\noriginal point = (10, 15)\ncompressed = (10, 1)\nuncompressed = (10, 15)\nElliptic Curve Domain Parameters for ECC\nECC elliptic curves are described by a set of elliptic curve domain parameters, such as the curve equation parameters, the field parameters and the generator point coordinates. These parameters are specified in cryptography standards, such as:\n\nSEC 2: Recommended Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters\nNIST FIPS PUB 186-4 Digital Signature Standard (DSS)\nBrainpool ECC Standard (RFC-5639)\n\nThese standards define the parameters for a set of named curves, such as secp256k1, P-521 and brainpoolP512t1. The elliptic curves over finite fields, described in these crypto standards are well researched and analysed by cryptographers and are considered to have certain security strength, also described in these standards.\nSome cryptographers (like Daniel Bernstein) believe that most of the curves, described in the official crypto-standards are \"unsafe\" and define their own crypto-standards, which consider the ECC security in much broader level.\nThe Bernstein's SafeCurves standard lists the curves, which are safe according to a set of ECC security requirements. The standard is available at https://safecurves.cr.yp.to.\nChoosing an Elliptic Curve for ECC\nTo use ECC all communicating parties should agree on the EC domain parameters (all the elements defining the elliptic curve). It is highly recommended to use a named curve from the above standards with at least 256-bit modulus. Standard curves are well studied by cryptographers to guarantee their security strength.\nDon't use own elliptic curve (with non-standard domain parameters), unless you are experienced cryptographer and you know very well what are you doing! Many curves have weaknesses, which make the ECDLP problem not so difficult and compromise the security. If you are afraid of backdoored curves, use a standard safe curve from the SafeCurves list.\nNamed Curves - Example\nIn ECC cryptography, elliptic curves over the finite fields are used, where the modulus p and the order n are very large integers (n is usually prime number), e.g. 256-bit number. The finite field of the curve is of square form of size p x p, which is incredibly large, and all possible EC points on the curve (the order of the curve n) is also a very big integer, e.g. 256-bit. For example, the domain parameters for the curve secp256k1 (the Bitcoin curve) are defined as follows:\n\np (modulus) = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEFFFFFC2F\nn (order; size; the count of all possible EC points) = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEBAAEDCE6AF48A03BBFD25E8CD0364141\na (the constant \"a\" in y^2 ≡ x^3 + a*x + b (mod p)) = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\nb (the constant \"b\" in y^2 ≡ x^3 + a*x + b (mod p)) = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007\ng (the curve generator point G {x, y}) = (0x79BE667EF9DCBBAC55A06295CE870B07029BFCDB2DCE28D959F2815B16F81798, 0x483ada7726a3c4655da4fbfc0e1108a8fd17b448a68554199c47d08ffb10d4b8)\nh (cofactor, typically 1) = 01\n\nWe already know that a 256-bit curve (which means that p and n are 256-bit numbers) provides 128-bit security strength, which means that to find the private key from the public key or signature, the best known non-quantum algorithm will take approximately 2128 operations. The above-defined ECC curve secp256k1 has 128-bit strength.\nPython Examples with the \"secp256k1\" Curve\nNow let's put in action the above domain parameters for the secp256k1 curve.

The private keys for the Curve25519 are 251 bits and are usually encoded as 256-bit integers (32 bytes, 64 hex digits). The public keys are typically encoded also as 256-bit integers (255-bit y-coordinate + 1-bit x-coordinate) and this is very convenient for developers.\nBased on the Curve25519 an ECDH function is derived, called X25519 (used for elliptic-key Diffie–Hellman key agreement schemes) and fast digital signature scheme is derived, called Ed25519, based on the the EdDSA algorithm. These schemes are very fast, because they involve multiplications and other simple operations with small integers (mostly 32-bit arithmetic), which can be efficiently implemented in the modern microprocessors (CPUs). Note that X25519 and Ed25519 use different encodings for the EC points, so they are not directly compatible and require conversion if you want to use the same public-private key pairs.\nCurve448, X448 and Ed448\nThe Curve448 (Curve448-Goldilocks) is an untwisted Edwards curve, defined by the equation:\n\nx2 + y2 = 1 - _39081_x2y2\n\nover the finite prime field 𝔽p, where p = 2448 - 2224 - 1. It has order of n = 2446 - 0x8335dc163bb124b65129c96fde933d8d723a70aadc873d6d54a7bb0d and cofactor h = 4. Like any other Edwards curve, the Curve448 has equivalent in the Weierstrass form (y2 = x3 + _a_x + b), but the above Edwards form provides significant optimizations in the EC point calculations and improved performance.\nThe Curve448 provides ~ 224-bit security level (more precisely 222.8-bits). The private keys for the Curve448 are 446 bits and are typically encoded as 448-bit integers (56 bytes, 112 hex digits). The public keys are also encoded as 448-bit integers.\nThe Curve448 is suitable for ECDH key agreement (ECDH function, known as X448) and for fast digital signatures (EdDSA algorithm, known as Ed448 or edwards448). Note that X448 and Ed448 use different encodings for the EC points, so they are not directly compatible and require conversion if you want to use the same public-private key pairs.\nCurve25519 or Curve448?\nPrefer Curve448 to Curve25519 when your application needs a higher level of security, but have in mind that Curve448 is about 3 times slower than Curve25519 and uses longer key length and signature length.\nPrefer Curve25519 to Curve448 when you need better performance and smaller keys and signatures.\nLearn more about the Curve25519 and Curve448 from the technical perspective from:\n\nRFC 7748 - Elliptic Curves for Security - the Internet technical standard for implementing the X25519 and X448 key exchange protocols.\nRFC 8032 - Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) - the Internet technical standard for implementing the the Ed25519 and EdDSA-Ed448 signature schemes.\n\nIn the general case, have in mind that Curve25519 is faster than secp256k1 and the other 256-bit standard NIST curves and is considered more secure, so it is the recommended choice for ~ 128-bit security. Similarly, the Curve448 has better performance than the classical curves with similar key length, so it is the recommended curve for ~ 224-bit security.\nCurve25519 - Example in Python\nTo demonstrate the elliptic curve Curve25519 in practice, we shall first install the pynacl crypto library for Python:\npip install pynacl\n\nThe Python binding to the Networking and Cryptography (NaCl) library (PyNaCl) implements many modern cryptographic algorithms, including the EC point arithmetic over the Curve25519 and Ed25519 signatures.\nNext, generate a random 252-bit private key and its corresponding public key (EC point) on the Curve25519 (both keys will be encoded internally as 256-bit integers):\nfrom nacl.public import PrivateKey\nimport binascii\n\nprivKey = PrivateKey.generate()\npubKey = privKey.public_key\n\nprint(\"privKey:\", binascii.hexlify(bytes(privKey)))\nprint(\"pubKey: \", binascii.hexlify(bytes(pubKey)))\n\nRun the above code example: https://repl.it/@nakov/Curve25519-in-Python. The sample output from the above code shows that both the public and the private (secret) keys on the Curve25519 are encoded as 256-bit integers (64 hex digits, 32 bytes) and this simplifies the developers:\nprivKey: b'8175f7cd524a59b6efbd447985ce5d97c546b319521ff236203970e50052c641'\npubKey:  b'cf97a96568fee4ddb232f617fd5b9df2d2e5b90e68ba7f6d5129ea92d7d8f95e'\nIn fact, different crypto libraries may use different key encodings and typically X25519 ECDH keys are encoded differently than Ed25519 keys (Montgomery curve coordinates vs. twisted Edwards curve coordinates).\n"},"digital-signatures/rsa-signatures.html":{"url":"digital-signatures/rsa-signatures.html","title":"RSA Signatures","keywords":"","body":"RSA Signatures\nThe RSA public-key cryptosystem provides a digital signature scheme (sign + verify), based on the math of the modular exponentiations and discrete logarithms and the computational difficulty of the RSA problem (and its related integer factorization problem).

ECDSA relies on the math of the cyclic groups of elliptic curves over finite fields and on the difficulty of the ECDLP problem (elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem). The ECDSA sign / verify algorithm relies on EC point multiplication and works as described below. ECDSA keys and signatures are shorter than in RSA for the same security level. A 256-bit ECDSA signature has the same security strength like 3072-bit RSA signature.\nECDSA uses cryptographic elliptic curves (EC) over finite fields in the classical Weierstrass form. These curves are described by their EC domain parameters, specified by various cryptographic standards such as SECG: SEC 2 and Brainpool (RFC 5639). Elliptic curves, used in cryptography, define:\n\nGenerator point G, used for scalar multiplication on the curve (multiply integer by EC point)\nOrder n of the subgroup of EC points, generated by G, which defines the length of the private keys (e.g. 256 bits)\n\nFor example, the 256-bit elliptic curve secp256k1 has:\n\nOrder n = 115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337 (prime number)\nGenerator point G {x = 55066263022277343669578718895168534326250603453777594175500187360389116729240, y = 32670510020758816978083085130507043184471273380659243275938904335757337482424}\n\nKey Generation\nThe ECDSA key-pair consists of:\n\nprivate key (integer): privKey\npublic key (EC point): pubKey = privKey * G\n\nThe private key is generated as a random integer in the range [0...n-1]. The public key pubKey is a point on the elliptic curve, calculated by the EC point multiplication: pubKey = privKey * G (the private key, multiplied by the generator point G).\nThe public key EC point {x, y} can be compressed to just one of the coordinates + 1 bit (parity). For the secp256k1 curve, the private key is 256-bit integer (32 bytes) and the compressed public key is 257-bit integer (~ 33 bytes).\nECDSA Sign\nThe ECDSA signing algorithm (RFC 6979) takes as input a message msg ****+ a private key privKey ****and produces as output a signature, which consists of pair of integers {r, s}. The ECDSA signing algorithm is based on the ElGamal signature scheme and works as follows (with minor simplifications):\n\nCalculate the message hash, using a cryptographic hash function like SHA-256: h = hash(msg)\nGenerate securely a random number k in the range [1..n-1]\nIn case of deterministic-ECDSA, the value k is HMAC-derived from h + privKey (see RFC 6979)\n\n\nCalculate the random point R = k * G and take its x-coordinate: r = R.x\nCalculate the signature proof: s = k−1∗(h+r∗privKey)(modn)k^{-1} * (h + r * privKey) \\pmod nk​−1​​∗(h+r∗privKey)(modn)\nThe modular inverse k−1(modn)k^{-1} \\pmod nk​−1​​(modn) is an integer, such that k∗k−1≡1(modn)k * k^{-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod nk∗k​−1​​≡1(modn)\n\n\nReturn the signature {r, s}.\n\nThe calculated signature {r, s} is a pair of integers, each in the range [1...n-1]. It encodes the random point R = k * G, along with a proof s, confirming that the signer knows the message h and the private key privKey. The proof s is by idea verifiable using the corresponding pubKey.\nECDSA signatures are 2 times longer than the signer's private key for the curve used during the signing process. For example, for 256-bit elliptic curves (like secp256k1) the ECDSA signature is 512 bits (64 bytes) and for 521-bit curves (like secp521r1) the signature is 1042 bits.\nECDSA Verify Signature\nThe algorithm to verify a ECDSA signature takes as input the signed message msg + the signature {r, s} produced from the signing algorithm + the public key pubKey, corresponding to the signer's private key. The output is boolean value: valid or invalid signature. The ECDSA signature verify algorithm works as follows (with minor simplifications):\n\nCalculate the message hash, with the same cryptographic hash function used during the signing: h = hash(msg)\nCalculate the modular inverse of the signature proof: s1 = s−1(modn)s^{-1} \\pmod ns​−1​​(modn)\nRecover the random point used during the signing: R' = (h * s1) * G + (r * s1) * pubKey\nTake from R' its x-coordinate: r' = R'.x\nCalculate the signature validation result by comparing whether r' == r\n\nThe general idea of the signature verification is to recover the point R' using the public key and check whether it is same point R, generated randomly during the signing process.\nHow Does it Work?\nThe ECDSA signature {r, s} has the following simple explanation:\n\nThe signing signing encodes a random point R (represented by its x-coordinate only) through elliptic-curve transformations using the private key privKey and the message hash h into a number s, which is the proof that the message signer knows the private key privKey. The signature {r, s} cannot reveal the private key due to the difficulty of the ECDLP problem.\nThe signature verification decodes the proof number s from the signature back to its original point R, using the public key pubKey and the message hash h and compares the x-coordinate of the recovered R with the r value from the signature.\n\nThe Math behind the ECDSA Sign / Verify\nRead this section only if you like math. Most developer may skip it.\nHow does the above sign / verify scheme work? It is not obvious, but let's play a bit with the equations.\nThe equation behind the recovering of the point R', calculated during the signature verification, can be transformed by replacing the pubKey with privKey * G as follows:\nR' = (h * s1) * G + (r * s1) * pubKey =\\\n**** = (h * s1) * G + (r * s1) * privKey * G ****=\\\n**** = (h + r * privKey) * s1 * G\nIf we take the number s = k−1∗(h+r∗privKey)(modn)k^{-1} * (h + r * privKey) \\pmod nk​−1​​∗(h+r∗privKey)(modn), calculated during the signing process, we can calculate s1 = s−1(modn)s^{-1} \\pmod ns​−1​​(modn) like this:\ns1 = s−1(modn)s^{-1} \\pmod ns​−1​​(modn) =\\\n\\= (k−1∗(h+r∗privKey))−1(modn)(k^{-1} * (h + r * privKey))^{-1} \\pmod n(k​−1​​∗(h+r∗privKey))​−1​​(modn) =\\\n\\= k∗(h+r∗privKey)−1(modn)k * (h + r * privKey)^{-1} \\pmod nk∗(h+r∗privKey)​−1​​(modn)\nNow, replace s1 in the point R'.\nR' = (h + r * privKey) * s1 * G =\\\n\\= (h+r∗privKey)∗k∗(h+r∗privKey)−1(modn)(h + r * privKey) * k * (h + r * privKey)^{-1} \\pmod n(h+r∗privKey)∗k∗(h+r∗privKey)​−1​​(modn) * G =\\\n**** = k * G\nThe final step is to compare the point R' (decoded by the pubKey) with the point R (encoded by the privKey). The algorithm in fact compares only the x-coordinates of R' and R: the integers r' and r.\nIt is expected that r' == r if the signature is valid and r' ≠ r if the signature or the message or the public key is incorrect.\nECDSA: Public Key Recovery from Signature\nIt is important to know that the ECDSA signature scheme allows the public key to be recovered from the signed message together with the signature. The recovery process is based on some mathematical computations (described in the SECG: SEC 1 standard) and returns 0, 1 or 2 possible EC points that are valid public keys, corresponding to the signature. To avoid this ambiguity, some ECDSA implementations add one additional bit v to the signature during the signing process and it takes the form {r, s, v}. From this extended ECDSA signature {r, s, v} + the signed message, the signer's public key can be restored with confidence.\nThe public key recovery from the ECDSA signature is very useful in bandwidth constrained or storage constrained environments (such as blockchain systems), when transmission or storage of the public keys cannot be afforded. For example, the Ethereum blockchain uses extended signatures {r, s, v} for the signed transactions on the chain to save storage and bandwidth.\nPublic key recovery is possible for signatures, based on the ElGamal signature scheme (such as DSA and ECDSA).\n"}}}
